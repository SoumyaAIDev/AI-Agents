4ajmfzj9G1g.mp3,"Hey there my friend, Adam here. Today I want to share with you seven marketing secrets or marketing hacks or marketing tricks. Essentially things that nobody's really talking about, not even me that often. And it's because they're a little more complicated and a little more nuanced than the quick hits that we often get when it comes to social media. Things post it this time or adapt your content for this algorithm tweak or use this kind of font or this kind of color or all of those things. What I'd rather do is get to the core of why your marketing may not be working as well as you want. And even if it is working okay, understanding the seven things I'm going to be walking you through here today will allow you to immediately upgrade all of it. Get better results, more clicks, more traffic, more sales from everything you do. And not only that, probably the most important thing that I could ever give you is to show you how to think about your marketing, how to process different marketing strategies. And basically the crazy stuff that goes on inside my head when I'm evaluating different marketing tactics and tools and resources and all of that. So my goal here today is as ambitious as it is, is to try to pack seven secrets and seven hacks into a very short period of time so that you're going to be able to watch this and you're going to be able to extract these little golden nuggets and apply them to your business, to your client's business, to whatever it is that you're doing. And it starts right now. So the very first thing that we need to talk about is kind of the first thing that we need to talk about is kind of what ends up happening when someone says, Hey, my marketing's just not working. it's just nothing's happening. No one's clicking. No one's watching my stuff. The algorithm isn't pushing it or promoting it to people. Nothing's working. It's something that I hear all the time. I see it in the comments below. Very common. 90% of the time it's because they're just not doing enough marketing. It's just a question of volume. It's a question of quantity, not so much quality. So let me explain. I don't know for this one. Maybe it's the get rich quick things. Maybe it's the, uh, all of the courses and the programs that promise that you can become a millionaire in 30 days with no work or whatever it is. But for some reason, when people think about marketing, they think that all they need to do is make a Facebook ad or an Instagram ad or post one video on YouTube and they'll just blow up and become the next viral sensation and everything will just work out miraculously well. And I seriously, I wish this was the case. That'd be amazing, but it's not right. It's marketing is just a business function. I'm going to make this sound horribly boring, but it's accounting or finance or legal aspects of a business or HR or sales or whatever it is. They're all just different business functions, which means that they require time. They require energy. They require money and investment in them in order to get them to work. Now, what ends up happening is most people will make one post on social media. It won't get the traction and then they'll swear off that platform. So they'll hop over here, try out Twitter now and make a couple of tweets. Nobody engages. So they will get frustrated and they'll get angry because it's just not working when the reality is they probably just haven't done enough. And that's why the first concept, the first sort of hack or secret is identifying the marketing sweet spot. So in the most rudimentary art drawing class ever, let me show you exactly what I mean by marketing sweet spot. And you can see where you fall and where the vast majority of businesses fall. And if you find yourself in this position, you know that the answer is to keep on pushing through. It's not to dial back, it's not to pivot, it's not to do anything that. It's just to keep going forward. So let me show you what that looks like. So I want you to imagine for a second, a bell curve, kind of the traditional bell curve. Of course, that'll be the, there we go. We'll get some ink flowing here. So this is our bell curve, our ugly, ugly bell curve. And it's going to have three, three different sections. Now over here on the left, this is what you're going to call the minimum effective dose. So the MED, the minimum effective dose, essentially what happens is you're going to have a minimum effective dose of $5. And what ends up happening here is until you're in this range, nothing you do matters. It's about sort of making that one post on social media that someone sees one time and then that's it. And then you wonder why it's not working. It's about spending a $5 on Facebook ads or Instagram ads and not getting immediate sales and then sort of swearing off the entire online advertising system and that. But the reality is we just haven't hit the minimum effective dose. There's not enough momentum. There's not enough exposure. There's not enough reach and engagement with the audience that you're trying to reach. And we're going to talk about that one in just a second. But this is where 90% of businesses fall as they sit around here in this minimum effective dose, kind of half committing to different strategies and then wondering why nothing's working. And the answer here, the solution is again, you've got to push through. You've got to move up here. And this is the sweet spot. This is where you're going to find sort of the saturation of your market. You're going to be hitting the number of times you've hit the minimum effective dose. You're going to be hitting the number of times you've hit the minimum effective dose. You're going to be hitting the number of times you've hit the minimum effective dose. You're going to be hitting points that are required. Again, we'll talk about that in just a second. You're going to be making sure that the people that you want to reach are actually seeing your content. You're going to make sure that you've essentially saturated everything that you can. Now, the reality is this sweet spot is huge, massive, massively huge. when we're thinking about your business, your market, or your industry, these are huge, huge industries, billions and billions of dollars. So unless your business is doing a billion dollars a year or more, there's more that you can do. It's crazy when I hear about something this, and I'm like, oh, my God, I'm going to be that. Well, look, I'm already posting once a day on Instagram, or I'm already making one YouTube video a week, or I've got a podcast. I'm pretty much maxed out. There's nothing else I can do. And they're sitting at, I don't know, say a million bucks a year. And they're in, let's use health and fitness. So if you're in, let's say, the health and fitness industry, this massive multi-billion dollar industry, and your business is doing a million a year, two million a year, a hundred grand a year, whatever it is, you haven't even scratched the surface for what you're capable of doing and for the amount of people that you could reach. So you could go from one post a day to five a day. You could go from one post a day to five a day. You could go from one post a day to five posts a day. You could make one video on YouTube to a week to one video on YouTube a day. You could do two videos a day. You could start other channels. You could have other podcasts. There's so much that you can do. Now, of course, at some point, you're going to reach this third area, which is diminishing returns. Diminishing returns. There we go. D for diminishing. Diminishing returns. There's going to be some point where eventually more money, more effort, more time isn't going to pay off. But I can't even begin to tell you of all of the businesses I've worked with over the last 10 years, the tiniest fraction falls in here. And typically it's when they're spending a million dollars a month on ads and they simply can't get in front of more people with their ads. So they're doing blogging. They're doing podcasting. They're doing SEO. They're running Google ads and Facebook ads and Instagram ads and all that. The biggest example here is if you're running some kind of search-based PPC pay-per-click advertising, a Google search ad. At the end of the day, you can't make people search for more stuff. So you can't make people search for more stuff. So you can't make people search for more stuff. So you can't make people search for more stuff. So you can't make people max out. But again, you can make that broader. You can go for discovery ad platforms Facebook and Instagram, where you can put things in front of people that may potentially be interested. There's a lot of ways. So the reality is let's find a bright, happy, colorful marker. This is where we're going for. This sweet spot here. everybody is down here in this sort of minimum effective dose. They haven't even scratched the surface for what's possible. And then they're wondering why their marketing is not working. The biggest, the best piece of advice of everything that I could give you here is really, you just have to do more. Now, of course you need to be strategic. You need to think through it. That's what the rest of this is going to be about, but more is your answer. So on that note, how much more? And that leads me to the marketing rule of seven. Now, depending on your business or market or your industry, depending on if you're selling something for low dollar value or high dollar value, it's kind of universally agreed that for somebody to make a purchase decision, for someone to take action and actually buy from you, they need around seven touch points, which means seven engagements, seven interactions, with your brand. You can't simply put something in front of them one time, expect them to buy, and then call it a day. You're going to have to do this multiple times. Seven. Now, if it's expensive, it's going to be seven to 14. If it's significantly cheaper, you're selling a pack of gum for 99 cents or something, you probably don't need seven touch points. One should be sufficient. But that rule of seven is important because it forces you to not give up too early. It's just when you're looking at the statistics around sales and you realize that most conversions, most closes for sales happen after five rejections or five follow-ups, five emails, five extra calls. It's rarely, if pretty much never, the first time. Same thing goes with marketing. Bit of a side note here, but marketing is kind of selling one to many. Sales one to one, marketing one to many. So we use the same concepts, the same strategies, all of that with sales. But I to think of marketing as a little more exciting and a little more challenging even because instead of trying to convince one person at a time and overcome their objections and their concerns, we have to do this en masse and we have to do it without really getting much feedback from our market. So rule of seven, that's important. Now, how do we do this? Well, we do this by showing up in front of our ideal target market where they're present and active, which means that we need to be selective about what social media platforms we're going to, about what kind of content we're creating, about where we're putting that. We need to make sure that it's in alignment, not only with you and your content style and what you doing and hate doing, but also where your people are. In fact, that's the most important element. There's no point on being on Twitter or Pinterest or TikTok or Instagram or YouTube if your people aren't there. So you've got to find out where they're present and active online, and then you've got to make it your mission to follow up and to make sure that you're consistently showing up in front of them with value, with content, and with offers. So that's the marketing rule of seven. Now, the next point is more of a psychological phenomenon, more of a mental hack that you can use. I've talked about this a ton on this channel here, but it's called the mirror exposure effect. And what the mirror exposure effect is, it's a psychological phenomenon that says we as people, as humans, we associate frequency with trust. So the more often that we show up in front of people, the more often that they see us, the more they know us, the more they us, and the more that they trust us. This kind of stems back to caveman days where if we saw something enough times and it didn't try to kill us or eat us, we assumed it was safe. Well, all of that programming, all of that evolution is carried forward to today. So now when we see things again and again and again, we naturally start to things more because we're familiar with them. They're less scary. They're less scary. They're less scary. And therefore we're more likely to trust them. So this is why that marketing rule of seven is so important. This is why following up is so important. This is why making sure that you've got a solid email marketing strategy in place is paramount. It's crucial. Probably the second most important thing I could offer here, if the first one is to make sure that you get out of that minimum effective dose zone and into the sweet spot by doing more. The second, probably most valuable piece of advice I could give you is to make sure that you're doing some kind of email marketing and you're doing it more than you think. And that's the third reason. There's this rule, this gospel in the marketing world that you should send one marketing email a week at most, maybe one a month, because you don't want to bother people. Garbage. It's absolute garbage. There's plenty of businesses and industries where you could send one email every three days. You could send one email a day. There's some businesses and companies that I've consulted for and done work with and own and have a stake in that do two emails a day. And it works. People don't get angry. They don't subscribe. You've just got to know who you're marketing to. And that's the third reason. There's this rule, this rule that you should be shooting for three emails a week, kind of at minimum. Otherwise, again, you're not going to have the chance to establish yourself and to take advantage of all of those touch points and the marketing rule of seven and the mirror exposure effect. And that leads me perfectly to the next kind of secret, which is that you really want to go deep rather than broad. So let me tell you what is probably my biggest pet peeve when it comes to marketing. And that's whenever I ask somebody, well, who's your target market? And they say everyone or people with money. And that's amazing. That'd be great. But there's 8 billion people on the planet. And I promise you, you don't want all of them. Even if they all wanted to do business with you, some of them are just terrible, terrible fits for your business. So why don't we rein that in a little bit? And even if we were to say, separate men and women, well, now we're down to 4 billion, or then we separate to this country. Now we're down to 100 million. And then maybe this area. Now we're down to 30 million. I mean, still, we're going to want to carve that down to a significantly lower number. Someone that you're going to be able to connect with, someone that you're going to be able to connect with on a deeper level. So the easiest way to do this is to take a look at yourself and your business. Now, I appreciate you are not your customer. You know, things that they don't know, you have experiences that they don't have. However, most people, when it comes to business, they're solving a problem that they had at some point. They're solving something that they know about, that they care about, that they want to share and help other people. So you probably understand a little bit about your situation and what they're going through. And therefore, you're more likely to attract people similar to you. It's another kind of same reason that if you're a personal brand or a coach or consultant or someone that, you tend to attract people, give or take 10 years around your age. So if you're 30, you'll attract 20 to 40. If you're 40, you'll attract 30 to 50, whatever it is. There's this 20 year sliding scale, 10 years on each side that tends to work. That can balloon out a little bit here and there, but on average, you'll find most of your people fall in that range. Again, it's just because you relate to them better. You know the words that they use. You grew up in the similar time. You have the same references, all of that stuff. But the point is you want to go deep here and you want to make better connections with fewer people than these superficial surface level connections with a ton of people. The big reason here is because when you go broad, when you go after everybody, you're forced to naturally water down your message. It becomes more vanilla. It becomes more bland. And it has to, because if you were being specific about someone's unique pains and unique problems, well, it wouldn't be appealing or interesting to everybody else. So therefore, you have to be more specific about what you're doing. And if you're not, then you're not going to be able to do that. You have to make it broad. And when you're broad, you're boring and everybody just ignores you. And you sound 99% of the other businesses and marketers out there saying the same things. we offer higher quality and we offer better service and all of that stuff that everybody's heard a million times before. And they're completely blind and deaf too. So the best way to solve this is to move on to our next point here, which is that you need an ICA. ICA is Marketing Talk for Ideal Customer Avatar. I'm not completely strict on this exact fictional representation of your ideal customer and you've got to give them a name and a hair color and they've got to wear this kind of shoes and listen to this kind of music. I don't think that's necessary. It's helpful at times. What I think is more important is that you get really clear around the commonalities, the common characteristics that your top customers, your top clients, your top audience members have in common. And we typically divide this into three different categories. The first of which being demographic. So what's their age, their gender, their income, their occupation, their title, all of those stereotypical marketing things that we associate. And then we have the other thing that's really important, which is that you have to number two, what are their geographic details? What city, state, province, country, where do they live? Number three, their psychographic details. This is all of the head stuff. And this is where the bulk of your ICA should really be formed. So what are their values, their attitudes, their interests, their beliefs, their organizations, their political affiliations, their lifestyles, things that make them them. After all, we often want to group people into these broad buckets men or women or this age or that age. But the reality is depending on what product or business you're using, you can have a wide range of that. And it may be more problem based. On the other hand, you may also have multiple different ICAs, ideal customer avatars. That's cool too. I'm all right if you've got like, look, we work well with women who are 20 to 25. And we also work well with men who are 40 to 45. But those two different ICAs are going to have different pains and problems and fears and frustrations. We'll talk about that in just a second. So you can serve them both, but you need to serve them both with different messages. You simply can't appeal to them, but you don't have to be like, oh, we're going to serve them both. You just have to be able to get rid of them both. And that's why you can't serve them both in a small way. But if you do have multiple ICAs, that's okay, because you can serve them both. So you can serve them both. And you can serve them both, but you can also serve them both in a more specific way. And when you're doing that, you're not going to end up using the same generic, brand, broad, bland terminology, because you're just going to turn the other one off by talking about things that are completely irrelevant to them. So you have an ICA, but make sure that it's specific and you can have multiple. And on that note, the way to dive into that is with the psychographic details of their values and attitudes, the money is, the value, the real results that you're going to get from your marketing come down to identifying their miracles and miseries. Now there's this great expression that I love that says customers don't buy when they understand, they buy when they feel understood. The way to make them feel understood is with this. So their miracles, that's over here. That's all the things that they want, their needs, their desires, their dreams, all of the things that they wish would happen, the desired end state of where they're trying to get. And then of course, over here, you've got their miseries. These are their fears, their problems, their pains, their frustrations, all of the things that they're trying to get away from, at least in regards to your business and to your offer. You need to identify what these are and ideally drill down into which the most important and the most painful ones are, and then what the most desirable end states are, because then you're going to be able to position your business as the bridge that takes them from miracle, to the most desirable end state that is possible. Ooh, there we go. Memo to self. I gotta buy some smaller tip markers. But that's it. This is your business right there. Your business's job, your offer, your product, your service, whatever it is that you sell, its only mission is to move them away from their current state that they're in right now, that they don't wanna be in, whatever that pain is and towards the desired end state. And the better that you're able to communicate that, which is essentially the job of marketing, it's to communicate the value of what you have, that's actually the most valuable part of your life, of what you have, to them in regards to your offer, your product, your service, the better you're able to do that, the more likely you are to get somebody to take action and to actually buy from you and move them here. And that's, this is where the conversions happen. It's right here. It's moving them away from miseries and towards miracles. And on that note, let's hit the next point here, which is a very cliched thing to say, but I want to break it down a little bit more. There's this super cliched saying in marketing that says you want to sell the benefits, not the features or sell the sizzle, not the steak. The problem is, is that most cliches, there's that element of truth to it. That that's absolutely the fact here is when it comes to marketing and to representing what it is that you're selling and what you're trying to promote, it's not about the features. It's about what those features are going to deliver through the benefits. That's what they're after. They don't care about features. They care about how those features are going to positively impact them. So yes, we can make a cursory mention of the features. But what we're after is that we're going to highlight the features. We've got to highlight them. We'll talk about them and we'll talk about kind of the flip side of that in just a second. But the real value is in the benefit. Now, one of my favorite examples, and it kind of stems from like, hey, sell me this pen. Well, it comes down to this pen doesn't actually have a pen cap, but we're going to use that analogy anyway. It's sort of like, well, why does the pen have a pen cap or fictional pen cap? And the reason that this pen has a pen cap and the benefits it provides, that's what we want to highlight. So the feature is a pen cap. The benefits is, well, it prevents you from getting ink all over yourself. And then of course we could elaborate on that. We could explain it a little further and so on. A bit of a side note. Do you know why pen caps have those tiny little holes? I don't know if you've got a pen around, you can find one, but they've got those little holes on the pen lid. It's actually so if you swallow it, you don't choke to death. Random, hey? Anyway, the reason that benefits work significantly better than features is because benefits are emotionally driven. And emotion is far more powerful driver than logic. Doesn't mean we can't have logic. Doesn't mean we shouldn't use logic. We absolutely should. But emotion is the moneymaker. That's what compels somebody to take action when they feel it deep down in their core. This is going to make my life better. This is going to help me achieve the goals that I want. This is going to increase my status. This is going to make me healthier or happier or wealthier or any of those intrinsic drivers that we have as humans. When we're able to properly communicate that, that's when conversions happen. That's when sales happen. Now here's the kicker. When you're first creating your marketing, whether it's through an ad or a sales page or a social media post or an email, or anything that, we always want to highlight the benefits. And then of course, we're going to talk about the features. But if for some reason people don't convert, we flip it. And then the next time we lead with features and we back up the benefits. And the reason that we do this is because we know that emotion is a significantly more powerful driver than logic. The logic still has a part. Not to mention, it's not that some people are, or it's not just that some people are more emotional than logical. We all know those people that fall on one end of the spectrum or another. But it's also that we, as people, we have days where we're more emotional or more logical. And within those days, we have hours where we're more emotional and more logical. And there's situations and circumstances that you can't always control for, which is why we really want to cover our bases. We want to, of course, lead with emotion because it's the most powerful driver, but we want to back it up with logic. The next time somebody interacts with us, if we tried emotion and it didn't work, we'll lead with logic and we'll back it up with emotion. And we'll kind of go back and forth. We'll sprinkle in social proof. We'll sprinkle in other forms of testimonials. We'll sprinkle in, you know, a little bit of a sense of, you know, what they're doing, what they're doing, what they're doing, what they're doing, what they're doing, what they're doing, what they're doing. And we'll use all of the tools in our toolbox as marketers to get somebody to take action, knowing full well that we don't have control over where they're at right now in their current situation. And it's funny, I didn't actually plan this, but this actually kind of leads us full circle back to that beginning statement of we need to highlight benefits. And if that doesn't work, we go for the logical element. And then we go back to benefits. All of this is going to take time. It's going to take energy, and it's going to take investment in your marketing, which is why if you're at this stage right now, where it's just not delivering the results that you want, you need to do more. Now, of course, I'm not going to leave you hanging with just that, which is why I'm going to link up a video right here. That's going to show you a digital marketing strategy. That's going to help. So make sure to check it out now, and we'll see you in the next video. Now, the worst defense here is not having a marketing funnel or more accurately, not thinking about your marketing funnel and instead just hoping and wishing."
4ti_uK60nLk.mp3,"So you're ready to start marketing, but you have no plan. Where do you begin? What should you include? How can you present it? You have the questions, we have the answers. Hello world, my name is Mike Ploeger and here at Visme we aim to make your work life easier. Whether it's design, presentations, or marketing, we have the tools to help you become a true professional. Marketing is a necessary operation for any business looking to take a leap towards success. However, if you don't have the proper experience, you might be lost on how to create a marketing plan and these are extremely helpful when it comes to understanding your business, clarifying your goals, staying focused, and keeping everyone on your team on the same page. In this video, I'll take you through the seven necessary steps to creating a winning marketing plan, as well as share a number of templates you can start with. Let's get started. Step 1. Understanding the purpose behind a marketing plan Understanding the purpose behind a marketing plan is step number one. Ideally, it should be used to help you set your goals, understand your target audience, and optimize the impact of your marketing campaigns. Communicating your big strategy or idea is what your marketing plan is all about. In order to do this, every marketing plan should consist of the following. Step 2. Understanding the purpose behind a marketing plan Number one, your short and long-term plan. Step 3. Understanding the purpose behind a marketing plan. Number two, a description of your target audience and their persona. And number three, one or more high-level marketing strategies and tactics. This infographic template available on Vizme right now features each of these key details. It clarifies the objectives, the target audience, and strategies in an easily consumable page. If you wanted to go the extra mile and include even more detail, you could also add an overview of the current market situation, key performance indicators, budget or financial considerations, or a timeline on when the plan will be carried out. Typically, all of this information is communicated on a PDF, just the one we just saw. But if you're feeling creative, try creating an infographic, a full presentation, or an interactive webpage to share your plan. Who knows, it could be the difference between your plan and someone else's. Without further ado, let's dive into 7 steps for creating an effective marketing plan. Step 1. Creating an effective marketing plan Step 1. Start with an executive summary. This is essentially a brief summary or overview of your entire company and the key details of your marketing plan. It highlights the function of your business and the purpose of your plan. This shouldn't be very long. The summary can include past achievements and the future direction of the company. Consider this template here. The details are concise and to the point. You want to tease your viewers on what's to come and get them on the edge of their seats. It's not overwhelming, just a quick introduction before you get into the meat of your plan. Step 2. Revisiting your company's mission, vision, and values is important to highlight early on. Why? It'll provide clarity and answer any questions as to why your marketing plan is the way that it is. It'll show viewers you had this in mind throughout your entire planning process. Templates this can help because it'll educate your viewers how your company got to the point they're currently at and where you're looking to be in the future. Step 3. Doing your research One of the first steps with any plan is doing your research. Study the market, study the competition, what are others doing that's working, and then what can you do to make it even better. Deeply analyze your own company's strengths and weaknesses. Touch on what you're doing well, but don't be afraid to communicate what you think could be stronger. A SWOT analysis, or strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats, is a great way to present your research. You can visualize the company's path, identify opportunities, set goals, and so much more. This template right next to me can be edited in Visme and is completely customizable. From the text content to the colors, fonts, icons, you name it, you can edit all of our templates to match your brand. You can do the same for your competitors. Compare your company with another one in the industry to see how they match your brand. You can also edit your own brand's content, and then you can edit your own brand's content. You can do the same for your competitors. Compare your company with another one in the industry to see how they match your brand. You can do the same for your competitors. Compare your brand's content, and then you can edit your brand's content. You can do the same for your competitors. You can do the same for your competitors. Compare your brand's content, and then you can edit your brand's content. It can be eye-opening, sure, but take a hard look at the competition. It's crucial if you want to compete in the market. After identifying your competition, you must identify your target customer. This will allow you to create more informed and tailored marketing strategies. Build a person from scratch. How old are they? What's their income? What are their interests? What do they value? A template this is perfect for putting that person you've built on paper and explaining him or her to your audience during a presentation or during a meeting. Or what's one way that's almost always used when someone wants to explain themselves for a job? Well, a resume, of course. This template more closely resembles an actual resume. It includes basic information, a photograph, personality traits, a bio, goals, frustrations. You can edit it however you see fit to describe your target audience. And if your target audience is a mixture of different people, try creating an infographic with data widgets. You can break down how much you should cater to one group or the other. There's a number of different charts and graphs you can use to help, but this template went with pie charts to break down target customer percentages. It's easier to understand than if someone was trying to explain it without a visual. Okay, you've done your research, you know your audience, now it's time to get started. Let's get started. Okay, you've done your research, you know your audience, now it's time to get started. Let's get started. Now it's time to outline your marketing goals. What are you hoping to achieve with your marketing plan? The most important thing to remember with this step is to be specific with actual numbers. If you're hoping to achieve more web traffic, don't just say, the goal here is to increase web traffic. Say, my goal is to increase traffic to our site by 30% within the next three months. You need a concrete goal, not a blanket statement. This template is simple, easy to digest, and lays out specific goals. They're all measurable and clear. Following the progress towards the goals won't be difficult with how definitive they are. And as I mentioned, deadlines could be used as well. If that's the case, a template this could be more fitting. In order for this company to accomplish a goal, these three phases must be properly carried out. Marketing plans this help viewers follow along as they can refer back to them if they start to get off track. Continuing off my last point, our sixth step is to lay out your marketing strategy from beginning to end. There's three details to write down and include with this step. One, what to do. Two, how to do it. And three, the channels to use. I highly recommend turning this into a visual so your team and audience can fully understand your thought process. To make it even easier for them, turn your strategy into a series of phases or steps. It could look something this, clarifying what needs to be done in each step, and then adding a new step to it. This is a great way to start your marketing strategy. So, let's get started. Let's get started. Before moving on. Or, if you want more certain dates and deadlines, this template here could be even better. Specific dates are laid out from the first phase of the project to the launch. If you want to ensure something is completed by a certain time, we highly recommend using this template. Infographics in general are wonderful for displaying information in a way that is easy to understand. People are much more likely to retain information paired with a visual rather than with text alone. Another template to consider is something this. Lay out all of your information in a detailed manner, leaving nothing to the imagination. Last but not least, detail the budget considerations for your plan. How much is it going to cost in order to reach your goal? It's important to be clear with this upfront, at least as best as you can. Marketing can be costly, and there are often a lot of hidden expenses. This may be the most helpful template of all. It clearly lays out the most important steps for your project, and it's also important to be clear with this upfront, at least as best as you can. The cost to your company. Try to set a cap early on so you have a goal to stay under from the jump. Okay, we've covered the steps for preparing your marketing plan. You should be able to put one together from start to finish, but I did want to share just a few more VisMe templates that may help you depending on what industry you're in.

5FJfEgE9RNg.mp3,"Hey, it's Rick Kettner here. And in this video, we're going to explore the best marketing strategy for promoting a new business or a new product. Essentially, we're going to be looking at a simple method that you can use to choose and execute on the best marketing opportunities for your specific business. Now, this is a follow up to a previous video that I published on 33 ways to get more customers. You can find a link to that video in the description box below. And of course, if you're interested in learning more about how to build and grow your business, then I recommend that you subscribe to the channel and turn on notifications so you don't miss out on future videos. But let's get into it. The number one reason why new businesses fail is that they don't attract enough customers. And the reality is a lot of businesses make it through the other stages, coming up with a brand name, coming up with a logo, even building out a basic product or service. But unfortunately, many of them fail when it comes to actually attracting prospects and converting those prospects into customers. So that is the entire focus of this video. We're going to be going through a simple four step framework called the Bullseye Framework. This is from Traction by Gabriel Weinberg and Justin Mares, a really great book for startups that are looking to attract customers to their business. And this is a simple, I say, a four step process that you can use to attract customers. The very first step is to brainstorm marketing ideas. So what you want to do here is you want to go through all the different ways that you could possibly attract customers to your business, and you want to come up with realistic scenarios for how you might execute on those opportunities. Now, I mentioned earlier that I recently published a video covering 33 ways to get more customers. You can go through that video. That's 33 different marketing channels that are covered in that video. And the idea here, even though we're not going to be pursuing all 33 channels at once, we'd be spreading ourselves way too thin. The idea here is to come up with realistic scenarios for each and every one of them, just as an exploratory process. So, for example, if you go down the list and you see content, marketing, you want to come up with a realistic scenario for how you might promote your business using content marketing. What kind of articles could you create? What kind of videos would you create a podcast? You want to explore exactly how you might pursue that opportunity if you absolutely had to. And then you want to do the same as you go down the list with search advertising, social advertising, hosting live events. You might consider, you know, would you host a local meetup, a small meetup group with enthusiastic customers? Or would you try to put on a big fancy event and invite other, other speakers, whatever the marketing channel might be? The idea here is to simply explore the possibilities, to reasonably brainstorm what you could do if you absolutely had to pursue the various different marketing opportunities that are out there. And the reason why this is important is because oftentimes businesses get stuck in a rut where they really only pursue marketing channels that all of their rivals are pursuing. So if you see another potential competitor using search advertising, you might be tempted to just say, okay, search advertising is the way that you market this kind of business. And that really limits your options. And unfortunately, when you follow that kind of strategy, you're actually playing into your competitor's strengths and you're pursuing a channel that is already going to be competitive, right? So by its very definition, the most popular channels may not necessarily be the best opportunities. Sometimes they are still, sometimes they aren't. So that's the entire point of this first step is to actually explore what you might do if you had to pursue. And that's what we're going to do today. We're going to go through a few different channels in order to just flesh them out and see what might be possible. Step number two is to select promising channels. So this is a very important step where we start to narrow the field. Instead of pursuing all 33 channels, we want to narrow it down to about three to five of the most promising opportunities. And when I say promising, because you're a startup, your number one priority should be speed. So you want to find channels that are likely to create results for you quickly. So you want to find channels that are likely to offer a lot of customers, right? So you're talking about both volume of customers and speed at which you can actually attract them. And of course, another consideration would be your ability to attract them profitably. So just because a channel can deliver a lot of customers and can do so quickly, you know, it might not be cost effective to pursue it. So that's the kind of thing you want to be thinking about as you narrow down the field to three to five of the most promising channels or the most promising opportunities based on your initial brainstorming. Now it's time to move on to step three. And step three is something that I think a lot of businesses skip over just naturally when they try to pursue marketing opportunities. And step three is to perform inexpensive tests. This is critical because even if an opportunity seems really promising, and as you go through how you might pursue it, it seems really attractive and it might be really exciting. The fact is not all marketing channels are equal. And sometimes you might be really surprised to find out that one channel just isn't that effective. And if you don't compare it to one channel, and you don't compare its results with another channel, then you're really never able to make that differentiation and to realize, hey, this might be a half decent opportunity, but over here is a much, much better opportunity that we should really be focusing all of our time and attention on. So this step is all about just simply performing inexpensive, simple tests to validate the potential of each of your promising opportunities. Now, one mistake a lot of businesses make when it comes to testing marketing opportunities this is they try to overly optimize in the process. So for example, if you were gonna place ads on Google AdWords, you might go on there and say, okay, I have $40 margin on my product. I can't afford to spend more than $40 per conversion here. And so if I'm spending more than that, then this channel just isn't very promising. And that thought process leads them to aim for targets and to set their ad spend in a way that is unlikely to provide really great results. And that's what I'm trying to do here. And the reason why this is bad is because the only goal of this step here is to validate two things. One, that there are enough customers in this channel that it's worth pursuing. And two, that you have a vague sense that if you took the time to optimize your efforts and to improve your ad copy and to improve your landing page and your entire marketing funnel as it relates to that channel, then over time, you almost certainly will be profitable. That's what you're trying to figure out. You're not trying to actually optimize because if you do that too early, you're ruling out a channel before you even give it a chance to breathe. So what you want to do here is just simply perform inexpensive tests to validate there are customers there and that it's worth your time and energy to pursue things further. And then afterwards, later in the future, you can worry about doing all that optimization. In some cases, it takes months, if not years, to really perfect your entire approach to that channel. And that's perfectly okay. You can do that in the future and it's not going to affect your long-term potential with that channel. But the idea behind this is that you're going to have to do a lot of work. And the reason behind this step is just simply to validate that it's worth your time to explore things further. And then we move on to step number four, which is to look at all these tests that we performed and to select one promising channel, to select the single thing that we're going to focus on when it comes to building momentum with the business. And this is incredibly important when it comes to a brand new startup because you really can't afford to be spreading yourself too thin. And the reality is that when it comes to a lot of marketing channels, there's a bit of a winner take all dynamic that happens with marketing channels. Google search is a great example of this. The person that is able to best optimize and best outperform their rivals when it comes to advertising for a specific keyword or a specific family of keyword phrases, they tend to far outperform whoever is second in that area. Whoever is second best at utilizing that marketing channel. So it really pays to become an absolute master at least one channel when you're growing a business. In fact, that's pretty common wisdom within the marketing community that you really, if you want to have a successful business, there should be at least one channel out there that the entrepreneur or founder, or at least one of the co-founders of the business is incredibly familiar with and is very proficient at using. And that really gives the business a lot of strength. And so the idea here is really simple, right? You just want to focus on one channel. You want to become really great at that one channel and you want to absolutely focus your efforts on capitalizing on all of the potential of that channel until of course you hit diminishing returns. And that's the point at which spending more money on the channel doesn't really give you more results. You might find a point, let's say Google AdWords, you might find spending more than 50,000 in a given period just simply does not increase results. And at that point, it's time to revisit this process, explore other channels and figure out what second or third channel you can tag on to expand your business. But that's really the process here. It's really straightforward. It's really simple. It might almost seem too simple, but that's okay. And you can do that. And it's a very powerful way to, I say, select and test and ultimately find the one channel that is most promising for your business. Anyway, that's it for this video.

here you drive a Ferrari you have to make such decisions here now you have come in the Ferrari so you can't stay in thinking here you will think I will see I will do till then it will go away by hitting 100 points so keep this in mind here we have one year time frame here we have taken a time frame of 1 minute our time frame will be of 1 minute and what to pay attention to in this pay attention to this that 30 point window means above the round figure 30 points 100 round figure happened 200 round figure happened 300 round figure happened above this 30 points and below this 30 points and below this 30 points if we want to see in buying then above 300 30 points pass here in the middle of this range the first minute candle must have put high keep in mind this is only 3 to 4 times in the whole month you will get this but when you get 100 to 100 points you will see a very good move but the condition is that the first condition is that the first candle's high if we are looking at it in the buying side then the first candle's high between 300 and 330 between 200 or 230 between 100 or 130 similarly we are holding above 30 points round figure the high should be placed in between after the high is placed in between this candle is broken so this is the first condition that our round figure should come the second condition is that this move should have break out in second or third candle we are not going more than the third candle if found in second then it is very good if not in second then more if the third candle should have a high break if the high is broken then we have taken the trade and here you don't have to think if bank nifty is suppose in this candle as this candle's high is that is here of 143 sorry है आपको इंट्री देना है आपको सोचना नहीं हो सकता

IjS9eTpmhgk.mp3,"Hey there, my friend, Adam here. And today I wanna walk you through 10 marketing tips and tactics and strategies, or rather give you a framework and a playbook that you can use to create marketing that works, that converts, that's profitable and helps you grow your business or any business you're working on. What this is going to help you do is essentially anytime that you're sitting down and you're thinking of ways to generate new customers or more leads or make more sales or launch a new campaign, it's gonna give you a framework and a roadmap that you can follow from start all the way to finish to make sure that you're doing the right things in the right place for the right people, rather than just randomly guessing and hoping and praying that this might all just magically work, which let's be honest, isn't much better than gambling. And that makes no sense at all, especially when there is a far more proven and strategic path that you can follow, one that has been replicated thousands, if not tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of times, both for myself and for my clients over the past 10 years and one that I know that if you follow and you work through, what I'm about to share with you will have amazing and positive effects on your business and your marketing as well. So with that said, let's dive right in. Now, what you're looking at right here is the original kind of brainchild behind all of this, just a mess of words and of thoughts and ideas, all kind of tossed down on the paper. Of course, in typical Adam fashion being slightly a bit of a perfectionist, still working on it. Anyway, I cleaned it up a little bit. I made a better and cleaner diagram for you. And that's what I wanna walk you through here today, essentially starting in the middle and then working our way out. See, the problem is, when most people think about marketing, they think about business planning and strategy and things that, they view it as this linear path. I'm gonna do this and then I'm gonna do that and then it's gonna be followed by this. When the reality is, it's often a lot more of this kind of rollercoaster ride. We're gonna try this, we're gonna get data and feedback, we're gonna look at the analytics and the metrics, we're gonna pivot and adjust accordingly, then we're gonna go in this direction, then we're gonna move this, then we're gonna base those decisions off everything we've just done and what worked and what didn't. And it continually evolves and you need to be able to evolve and adapt with it. All that said, there is a set of steps that you want to take. You don't wanna just go out there and start posting on random social media accounts because then nothing's going to work, you're gonna get frustrated, you're gonna get burned out and then you might just give up on the whole thing altogether. And that's not good for you, it's not good for the people that you hope to serve, it's not good for anyone. So the very first thing that you need to do anytime you're launching a new campaign, whether it's an existing business or you're thinking of starting a new business, is you need to start right in the center here with the offer. Now, I could, I could, make you struggle to understand my terrible handwriting was mocked up the time before, but I've taken the effort to go and let's see if this works. I don't have perforated paper, but that worked better than I thought. So here we are. Step number one is the offer. Now, there's a bit of a debate in the marketing community about when it comes to starting a business, when it comes to growing an existing business, do you focus on the offer first or the target market? In other words, do you want to make something and then find people to sell it to or do you wanna find people that you can help and then make something to solve their problems? No one seems to agree on this, so I've got a solution. If you have a brand new business, you've never sold anything to anyone, you just have this idea in your mind, then typically you're better off thinking about the people that you seek to serve. Those are going to be people that you may have been one in the past or that you resonate with or that you're currently a member of the group. And the reason is, is because the better that you're able to understand your target market and their pains and problems and fears and frustrations and all the things we're gonna talk about in just a minute, the better you're going to be able to position your product or your service or your offer as the solution to their pains and problems. On the flip side, if you already have an existing business, you've been in business for any length of time, then the odds are good that you already have a number of different products or services or things that you're selling. So the key here is to be specific and strategic and selective and make sure that you're choosing the right offer with the best margins that is the most fun to deliver, that has the highest potential for scalability, that's easy to sort of market and clearly describe. So to recap all of that, if you've got a new product or a new offer or something you're thinking of selling, do a little bit of market research, find the ideal segment of people that you can best serve and then make sure that there's a match there. If you already have an existing business, the odds are good that you've been selling something. So find out what it is about that makes it unique and then find the best people that you can continue to serve by 80-20ing your existing customers. Essentially taking a look at the top 20% of your customers. What are their commonalities, their traits? What do they, sort of have in common? Where do they live? All of the things that we're going to talk about in just a second when it comes to market. All right, so that is our offer and that's going to form the core of everything that we do from this point on. Everything is going to be in alignment with this offer. It's going to be in service of this offer. Marketing is done and won one single offer at a time. You may have a number of different things you can do or want to do, but that doesn't mean you want to blast somebody with all of your different offers because it's going to lead to overwhelm and to confusion and to this sort of paralysis by analysis, not knowing what to do or how to do it and confused customers don't buy. So we start here. Okay, so now that you've got the offer in mind, the next thing that you need to do is move on to this section here. Goals. Now here's the deal. When it comes to setting goals for your marketing, I'm not a stickler for making sure that you, you set exact specific measurable goals. we want to increase our cost of acquisition or decrease our cost of acquisition by 3% or increase our leads by 22.8%. But I do need you to have a North Star. A guiding sort of area light to work towards to make sure that you're going on the right path rather than taking all of these completely irrelevant paths and ending up somewhere completely different that's not going to benefit you or your business or the people that you seek to serve. Good example here is that most business owners, most entrepreneurs, most marketers, sadly, they do marketing for the sake of marketing. They were told that, hey, we need to do some marketing. We need to make some stuff. So they make some stuff and then they put it out there and unsurprisingly, it doesn't resonate because it's just stuff. Or they may have the wrong kind of goal, which is creating stuff for the sake of getting likes or comments or shares rather than building a community and increasing engagement with the right kind of people that will lead to leads, that will lead to customers, that will lead to sales and revenue and actual business growth. Now, fortunately, when it comes to setting goals, the end goal is normally pretty simple. I mean, it's going to be an increase in sales or an increase in revenue. And then all you have to do is start to work your way backwards to assign relevant metrics and KPIs known as key performance indicators, and then you can start to work your way backwards to assign relevant metrics and KPIs known as key performance indicators, to make sure that everything is in alignment. For example, if you have a thousand dollar product to sell and you know that you sell it by phone and you close one in two sales, well, now we figured out, well, we're going to need two sales calls to make one sale. And then, okay, well, how many leads do we need to generate in order to have those two sales calls? And then how many clicks do we need to get those leads? And you can start to work your way back and at least it gives you sort of a right direction to move towards. Okay, next up, we are going to draw the line and this one is all about target market. Target market, possibly the most important element in all of marketing. In fact, the word marketing, right? We've got market baked right into it. That's how important this is. They are the core, the central component of your entire campaign, the entire structure. Everything you do is about your target market and what's in service to them. You see, the reality is, is that when it comes to marketing, the customer doesn't buy when they understand, they buy when they feel understood. And that's all about empathy. It's about awareness. It's about being able to put yourself in their shoes, to view things from their perspective. See, the reason that a lot of marketing doesn't work, doesn't connect with the target market is because it's not relevant. It's not, it doesn't resonate with them. They don't understand how this would apply to them. And so they just tune it out. Good example here. If you've ever seen a commercial or a YouTube ad or a Facebook ad or any kind of ad or marketing material at all, and you thought, this is really dumb. seriously, this makes no sense. I don't even know what they're trying to sell. And if you do happen to figure out what they're trying to sell, you think, what a dumb product. Who would ever buy that? And here's the thing. The product, the service, whatever it is being sold, might not be dumb. And the ad might actually be really good, but you're not the target market. Now, sure, their targeting could be off. I don't know why you're seeing the ad that's not meant for you. Sometimes these things happen. But the point of the matter is, is that as long as you're specific and relevant to the right kind of people, you will get them to take action. They will be inspired to want to get the solution to the problem that they have, provided that you've properly articulated it. That you've said the right words in the right way at the right time. On the other hand, if you water down your message by trying to appeal to everybody out there, it becomes very bland and very boring and very generic. And then people just automatically tune it out. And you know exactly what I'm talking about. Talking about the things or the ads, the marketing that says we provide better service or faster delivery, or we're superior, or whatever it is. First of all, these are not specific terms. They're very ambiguous. They could mean a lot of things to a lot of different people. Second of all, pretty much everybody can be a target market. Everybody can say them. Therefore, everybody does say them. Therefore, they mean nothing. Anyway, I'm going to dive into more of the specifics on that in just a second. But first, let's figure out your ideal target market, your ideal customer avatar, also sometimes known as an ICA. And to do that, we break it down into three different categories. The first of which is their demographic details. These are the stereotypical things you think of when you think of marketing and think of a target market. So age, gender, income, occupation, titles, all of the things that are just the generic customer avatar right there. Then we have geographic details. What city, state, province, country, principality, municipality, neighborhood. Where do they live, basically? This is incredibly important because there's going to be cultural differences between not only different countries, but also different cities and sometimes even different neighborhoods in different cities. And then, of course, you have the mother of all, the psychographic details. What are their values, their attitudes, their lifestyles, their beliefs? What organizations are they a part of? Religious affiliations, political leanings, all of that stuff. All of the things that are not political and that people don't to talk about around the dinner table. Those are the things that you want to know. You want to get into their head and you want to know kind of what do they really think about these things that we're not supposed to talk about? Now, I'm not suggesting you make all of your ads and all of your marketing directly call this stuff out, but it still is important to keep in the back of your mind when you're creating your marketing materials. What are these people going to like? What are they not going to like? What are they going to find offensive? And what is going to be polarizing, but in a good way that's going to draw them in and really reject and repel everybody else that you just don't want to deal with? After target market, well, of course, we have to drill down into those psychographic details even more. And to do that, we're going to sort of break apart their miracles and miseries. Now, miracles and miseries are things that I've coined that essentially make up the two different areas of your target market. Their miseries being their fears and problems and pains and frustrations and nightmares and all the things they're trying to get away from. And their miracles being all of their wants and dreams and goals and desires and aspirations and all the things that they're trying to move towards. Every person, every target market, every business has a way to appeal to someone's miseries as well as to their miracles. There's going to be different industries that lean one way more than another. There's going to be segments of the market that lean more one way or another. In other words, if you use messaging that helps someone move away from pain, sometimes that's stronger. On the other hand, you have more aspirational language helping someone achieve something and different markets are going to benefit more from that. A decent mix of both is usually the best path. We don't want to constantly be negative and say this is a horrible thing and you need to get it fixed and blah, blah. Otherwise, you're going to come off as a Debbie Downer. On the other hand, if all you're promising is rainbows and sunshine and unicorns and all the magical things in this world, well, they're not going to have any reason to take action if you don't sort of back that up with a little bit of pain. In other words, a solution without a problem is completely meaningless. You need to put the solution in context to an actual problem that they have. Now, here's where things get confusing. Okay, the miracles and miseries essentially form a gap, a gap between where they're at right now with all of the bad stuff going on and where they want to be with all of the good stuff that they'd to have. And it's your marketing's job to help them bridge that gap away from miseries and towards miracles. And the better you're able to communicate that and show how if you do these things, if you acquire this product, if you use this service, if you take me up on this offer, you're going to be able to have it. Well, the better you're able to clearly communicate that, the better all of your marketing and all of your sales are going to be. All right, moving on. Next up, we have present and active. Now, this one is a bit of a pet peeve of mine. I've got a few different marketing pet peeves, one of which is when I ask someone who their target market is and they say everyone or everyone in the world or people with money. And of course, as we've already covered, you can't be that broad, otherwise you end up with completely boring and bland and irrelevant messages. The other pet peeve I have is when people, business owners, entrepreneurs, marketers occasionally, hear about a new platform or a new social media channel or a new marketing opportunity and they dive right in without doing all of the things that we've just covered, all of the more important things that need to happen first, identifying the model, figuring out the target market, working out their miracles and miseries and all of those details. Instead, they just dive headfirst into this new platform, make a bunch of stuff, nothing works, and then they swear off the platform for good. Well, unsurprisingly, the reason this doesn't work for most people most of the time is because this may be the completely wrong platform for you, for your business. Your people might not even be there. Your marketing in what I call the marketing wasteland, an area that is completely devoid of potential prospects and customers and leads for your business. Much better alternative to identify your ideal target market, figure out their demographic details age, gender, income, occupation, and then match it up with what social media platforms appeal to that demographic. Fortunately, this is not secret knowledge. All you have to do is head over to Google and type in social media demographics. You'll get a long list of different resources and it'll start linking up men between the ages of this and this are on this platform and women between the ages of this and this are on this platform and this platform appeals to these kind of people. It changes all the time, but there are a few pretty safe bets. For example, if you're in the business-to-business community, you're selling to other businesses, LinkedIn is kind of a staple. If you're serving a demographic that's 35 or 40 and older, Facebook is still probably your best bet. If on the other hand, most of your customers are 35, 30, 25 perhaps, we're looking at Instagram. TikTok, being the new kid on block, does skew younger, but all social media platforms, all platforms in general, it is aging up and doing so relatively quickly. So you can find people there 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s, and it's continuing to age up. Twitter still skews slightly younger and a little more urban. Pinterest still primarily women. YouTube does tend to be kind of neutral territory for all people looking for all things. There is a kicker that you need to make video content, of course. More on that in a minute. And then of course, there's others that are popular in different countries, different Reddit forums, different WhatsApp groups, Snapchat, if your demographic is much younger. Lots of options, too many options. That's why people get confused. See all these options. They think they need to be on all of them. The reality is you're much better off to choose the one or maybe two different platforms where your ideal target market is present and active and then go there ignoring everything else. So let's draw our line and move on. So now that we've figured all that out, the next thing that we need to do is we've got to figure out what kind of content are we going to make? And that leads us to content type. Now, what I'm going to suggest here is that we need to establish a content type that you're going to start with. This may ultimately be or not be where you end up. We're going to talk about that more in a minute as well. Lots of cliffhangers and open loops in this video. So keep watching. The point is, though, is that there is a lot to unpack and where we're going to start is going to be different than where we end up because I'm going to give you a couple of different options, but some are significantly superior to others. So here's what you've got. You've got text-based content, you've got audio content, and you've got video content. Arguably, you also have some kind of visual graphical content infographics and visual diagrams and things that, but typically they're paired with one of the other kinds of content. You also have different lengths of content, short form and long form content. My suggestion is that pretty much every business out there needs one form of long form content, and then you can do whatever short form content you to feed into it. So long form content for text is obviously a blog. Long form content for audio is a podcast. And long form content for video would be YouTube. Short form content, though, we're talking about short tweets, we're talking about short captions for Instagram, we're talking about Facebook posts, we're talking about LinkedIn posts, anything that for text. Audio is a little trickier. We're still kind of looking at mostly podcasts, possibly shorter ones, or taking clips and adding video elements to them. And then short form video is kind of the rage right now. Short form, vertical video. We're looking at Instagram Reels, we're looking at YouTube Shorts, we're looking at TikTok. So if you don't mind writing, you can start with text. If you don't mind speaking, you can do audio. And if you don't mind doing video or getting in front of a camera, finding someone that's willing to get in front of a camera, video is by far the best one. But again, we'll talk about that in a minute. So we'll get our arrow there, and then let's do our next one, which is mandatory marketing. No exceptions. Every business needs to use this. It's email. Yeah, I know. Hoping for something a little sexier myself. But the fact is, is that email works. It works just as well now, if not better than it ever has before, because everybody uses email. I use email. You use email. Your customers use email. Your doctor, your accountant, your lawyer, everybody. Everybody that you know has an email address. Not everybody has a social media account. Not everybody accepts SMS or text message marketing or even appreciates it. Direct mail is still phenomenally effective, but it's hard to find curated lists, especially for cost-effective prices. And it's a slightly more advanced and complicated marketing strategy that I wouldn't suggest starting out with. But everybody has email. Bit of a fun fact here, but when I'm working with a brand new business, I'm doing any kind of consulting or teaching, one of the very first things I do, if not the first thing I do, is take a look at their overall email marketing strategy. If they don't have a good one, we'll install one. If they have one that's working okay, we'll upgrade it. And I kid you not, every single time we're able to make substantial and significant increases in profitability, in customer retention, in the number of sales made. It's just, it's as close to a magic bullet as we have. So, where do you even get started? Well, the very first thing you need is some kind of a lead magnet, also known as a bribe or a freebie or a content upgrade. Essentially, something that you can give away in exchange for a customer's email address so that they're actually in touch. So for instance, if you're not the first one to join the list, what's the easiest thing you could do? If you are, you could just go, just take your email address card, manage more, or maybe even get your email for a timer. Just a couple of gre Bal detto. But I don't think no one can strongly recommend having this kind of codebook tool difference in any kind of booking due to traffic, and also just start thinking about what services you further should approving or вещ. If you could figure out, a branch there, and you just have broad options, maybe you can actually reach out to them there. From there, you need to decide on your email frequency, how often you're going to be emailing your list, whether it's once a week or three times a week. Some people email daily. I've done it in the past. I've kind of found a sweet spot around three to four times a week. Once a week is your bare minimum. Once every two weeks is unacceptable. Once a month, and I don't even know why you have an email list. I mean, seriously, let's just run the math for a second. If an email open rate is say 30% for your list and you're emailing once a month, well, it could be months before anybody sees you. And then when they finally do get your email, they've forgotten who you are. So they're likely to unsubscribe or be worse, market as spam and just delete the whole thing. Also depending on which statistic or study you read, marketing via email has been reported to provide somewhere between a 3,800% and 4,400% ROI or return on investment. I don't know if my numbers are right around there, but they wouldn't be too far off. It's that good. Long story short, email. You got to do it. Okay. Moving on to the next one. Essentially, once you've got some of these pieces in place, it's time to start looking at how you're going to start putting things together. And that comes in the form of a marketing funnel, also known as a sales funnel, also known as a customer journey, or just a funnel. Aptly named because it kind of looks a funnel with a whole bunch of people coming in at the top and then kind of getting sorted out as they go through the bottom with fewer customers coming out the bottom. This is a reminder that most won't. I first heard this from Frank Kern who said most won't. In other words, most people won't click. Most people won't subscribe. Most people won't buy. And you need to factor that into your marketing and plan accordingly. But this is totally fine. This is totally okay because most won't, but enough will, provided you do things right. Now what a marketing funnel is really about is mapping out the customer journey, taking someone who has no idea who you are and walking them through all of the steps in order to become a lifelong and loyal customer, a brand ambassador, someone that loves you, loves what you do, wants to tell everyone about just how great you are. And you're pretty great. Now the opposite of having a marketing funnel is just having nothing. I don't know what the opposite of a funnel would be. a plate. You just pour stuff on it. It splashes everywhere. Sadly, most people have marketing plates. In other words, they just take all of the traffic and all of the leads and they just dump them somewhere, typically on their homepage. Meaning that someone shows up at your website's homepage. They have no idea what they're doing. They don't know where to go. They might click the contact button, but there's a weird form and they don't know if they want to do that yet because they just met you. It's kind of pushy. Let's slow down here. So they kind of skirt around a little bit and then they bounce, which is marketer term for leave and never come back. Again, depending on what statistic you use. The vast majority of visitors to a website that click the back button never return somewhere around the range of 98 to 99%. Where are they going? You might ask. And let me tell you, they're going to your competitors that actually have a funnel. Something that says, Hey, you're new here. Let's start here. Let me give you this thing. Let me nurture you and provide you some value. Let me follow up, see if you have any questions and let me continue offering you the next step in the process in order to becoming a customer. Now the best advice that I can offer in a short period of time when it comes to mapping out your marketing funnel is to start at the end. Start with your goals and then reverse engineer the process. So in other words, for someone to make a sale, well, what needs to happen before that? Maybe it's visit a sales page. Okay. Well, what needs to happen before they visit a sales page? It's like, okay, well they need to click a link. Okay. Well, what needs to happen for them to click a link? Are they getting it through content or through email? And then if they got on your email, how are they getting on your email? And essentially you can just work your way backwards through the process. And then once it's all mapped out, that's where things get really exciting. Yeah. Kind of nerdy about this stuff. Because once it's mapped out. Yeah. You can start looking for gaps for leaks in your funnel. You can start finding areas where you're losing people through some random mistake or messaging. This just doesn't quite line up. For example, if everybody's clicking over to your sales page, but nobody's opting in or nobody's buying. Well, now we know we have a conversion issue on the sales page. On the other hand, if people are joining your email list, but then never opening any of your emails. Well, now we know we have an issue with congruence between what was promised and what's being delivered, or perhaps we're just collecting bad emails. Or if we map it all the way out. Then we get to the sales call and we realize that we're only closing one in four or one in five when we should be closing one in three or one in two. Well now we know we can start looking at that and we can look at all of the steps up to it. And was there a congruence issue again? Were there pricing expectations? Were there other objections and sales issues that we could have overcome in our marketing prior? What's really cool about this is that we make a small tweak over here and we increase conversions by 2% and we increase that one by 3% and that one by 1%. Well, it's not we're adding these things up. Just one after another, they compound. So an increase by 3% here could lead to 10 or 20 or 30 more sales, which could then lead to thousands or tens of thousands or even millions more dollars in revenue at the end. Speaking of revenue, next step here after our funnel is CLV, which stands for customer lifetime value. Sometimes referred to as LTV for lifetime value or LCV for lifetime customer value, whatever it is. It's pretty much all the same thing. Which is what is the value of a customer to your business over their lifetime? Period. Now, some people look at this in revenue. Some people look at it in profit. I typically to look at it in profit, but it depends on the formula that we're looking at. The point is, if you've never done this before, this is an incredibly powerful exercise to run through to figure out just how valuable someone is to your business. And I'm willing to bet regardless of what business or market or industry you're in, it's significantly higher than you thought, which means that you now have permission to do significantly more marketing. And invest in significantly more content because you know just how profitable and how valuable new customers and new clients and new sales are for your business. So that's step one, figure out what is your CLV. After that, you need to find ways to encourage and increase retention. The number of clients and customers that you're going to keep, the length of time that you're going to keep them, and then finding other ways to increase that customer lifetime value. Either by selling them more things, by selling them more things more often, by increasing the price. By providing upsets. By providing upsells and downsells and cross-sells. Essentially other ways and other opportunities to solve problems that they have. And that's an important point to make here. What we're doing with our marketing and with our offers is we're solving problems that they have. And when we solve a big enough problem, we're rewarded in direct proportion to the value of the problem we solve. This is why some people make a whole lot of money. It's because they solve big problems. Some people struggle to make any money at all because they're just not solving enough problems for enough people or they're not solving big enough problems for enough people. So that is CLV. And what you may notice is that is kind of the final ring of our concentric expanding circles. Right? Moving all the way out. But we still have one left. And the reason that I almost didn't want to give it a ring of its own but rather have it sort of circle the whole thing is because, especially today, especially now and moving into the future, it's so important that it almost needs to overlap and encompass everything else that we're doing. This is going to support all of the marketing of your offer. Okay. Again, I wanna give it a try. No need to get sigue. No need to get sick. No need to get sick. It's going to help move you towards your goals faster than you ever thought. It's appealing to every target market. More people consume this kind of content than anything else. It basically checks the box for being able to clearly articulate miracles and miseries. It works with almost every single platform, which means we can put it in front of people and where they're present and active online. It's the best content type. We can embed it in email. It works as part of the funnel, so on and so forth. Probably no surprise here that the final piece of the puzzle is video. Essentially, the big question that you want to ask yourself here is how can you supercharge everything you're doing with a video marketing strategy? Now, clearly, for long form video, YouTube is the best place to do it. That said, I appreciate that if you've never done video marketing before, if you're just getting started, you're not comfortable in front of a camera, that's a pretty big ask. So we can put that on the back burner for now. And there are a lot smaller and somewhat still very effective steps that you can take leading up to this inevitable conclusion. Number one, start with stories. Grab your phone. Start with stories. Grab your phone. Look into it. Hit record. Go live for 15 or 30 seconds and share some kind of valuable tip or insight or story or something that's going on. Very low barrier. No editing required. Raw and authentic will beat overly produced and polished every single day of the week. If you feel taking it up a step further, do more of them. Once, twice, three, four times even a day isn't a bad strategy. You can do them on Instagram. You can do them on Facebook. You can do them on a number of different platforms as well, depending on subscriber counts and what rules are coming and going. Stories are a great way to sort of dip your toes into the water and get started. Next, if you're willing to take it that next step further and you want to capitalize on all of the available organic reach right now, short form vertical content is still going to be your best bet. These are things Instagram Reels and TikTok and YouTube Shorts. The length of these varies. Different platforms tend to have preferences for different length videos, but typically we're looking at 15 to 30 seconds, 30 to 60 seconds, somewhere around that range. So what's something that you can talk about for 30 to 60 seconds? I'm willing to bet that if you've been in business for any length of video, if you've been in business for any length of time, or you have any sort of passion or interest in what you're doing, there's a lot of stuff that you could share that other people would be interested in hearing about. Of course, if you really want to dominate your space, become the leader in your industry, then YouTube is clearly going to be the winner here for long form video content. So don't be afraid to test it out. Upload a few bad videos at first. I mean, the beauty of just getting started is nobody's really around to watch your stuff. So you get a chance to sort of practice and experiment a little bit without all the judgment of the internet. Looking back on my first videos, they were awkward. And incredibly sweaty. And I was super nervous. And I didn't know how to use a camera, so it was kind of blurry. And I didn't know how to use a microphone, so it only came out of one side. Yeah, it was rough. But the point is, is that practice does make progress, and you've got to start somewhere in order to get better.

RmwI_QqcPQc.mp3,"If you want more eyes on your business and more sales in your bank account, social media marketing is the way to go. In this video, let's talk about how to market your business on social media. Here's the thing, I wanna let you in on a big secret. There are 3 main objectives to keep in mind with marketing your business on social media. And if you don't have this, then your strategy is broken. Then I'm gonna share with you 3 proven tactics for landing clients, growing your business, getting clients that even you love to work with and that love to pay you. What are the objectives of social media marketing? I'm so glad you asked. There's 3 of them. You ready for it? Lead generation, lead nurture, and lead conversion. If you don't have those, then your business is broken and you're just creating content for the sake of content and you're gonna keep running on this hamster wheel. And you and your business deserve way more than that. Every single piece of content that you create to market your business on social media should be reaching and accomplishing one of these 3 or all of these 3. Lead generation, lead nurture, and lead conversion. Every single piece of content should be reverse engineering what it is that you have to sell and how is that piece of content either generating, nurturing, or converting. Sometimes they can even be leading to all 3. For example, I might have a post where I'm telling a story about a strategy that I've used that changed my life, that changed my business, that helped me to make more money. And I can say, click the link below to get access to this thing. I'm gonna give it to you for free today. That post, that piece of content because it has a strong call to action is going to generate a lead because they can click through that call to action and they can join my email list which then they are going to be nurtured. But even if I back up to that post itself where I'm telling a really engaging story that I've created it with the strategy in mind. I want to give them this epiphany. That they walk away with thinking, that's the way that I can now also get this result. It's nurturing them before I've even generated that lead. And then the conversion comes on the back end after they've opted into my email list and maybe I have a nurturing email sequence that then brings them towards purchasing. You know, a consulting call with me or purchasing one of my courses and that's the conversion. So think about how every single piece of content is accomplishing one or all of those 3. Lead generation, lead nurture, and lead conversion. I would recommend you actually write that down on a sticky note, put it beside your computer so that you keep that in mind and never forget that when you're creating content. Because we are not here to create content for the sake of content. That's throwing spaghetti at the wall and seeing what sticks. We're not about that. We are doing this intentionally to grow our businesses, right? Right. After hearing that, I want to know what you think about that. Have you ever thought about that before? Have you unintentionally been just creating content for the sake of content or have you been using these 3? Let me know in the comments below. Having an effective social media marketing strategy is a key to success. I'm going to talk about that in a bit. I'm going to talk about that in a bit. But the first thing is so important. Why? Because this isn't a hobby, this is a business. We're not doing this just for fun although your business should be fun. We want to be creating something that is going to give us an ROI, a return on investment, a return on energy, a return on the money that we invest, a return on the time that we invest. Ideally, we want to be able to reach more people and you know it's kind of funny when I hear people talk about you know get rich quick schemes. I'm not trying to help you get rich slowly either. So when you have a strategy, that's going to be the fastest path to success. To cash, to growing your business, to reaching more people and making the impact that you want to make. And social media marketing can be one of the most effective ways because our audiences are on social media all the time and if we know how to utilize that to reach them, to give them value and then to lead gen, lead nurture and convert them into a customer. That's how we're going to grow and that's how we're also going to be able to make our impact in the world by allowing them to grow in the ways that our products and services provide. So just posting, just creating content. Spray and promote. Spray, putting it out, throwing spaghetti at the wall. That's not a strategy. Again, go back to lead generation, lead nurture and lead conversion. That is your strategy. So even if you're brand new to business, you might be thinking, well how do I create a strategy if I've never done this before? I got to test my content. Absolutely. But you're also going to test your content with intention. As a new business or an existing business, these following tips are going to be really important for you to make sure that you have them in place. First of all is your branding so that people can recognize you. If I were to say to you right now, just do it. What does that make you think of? Nike, right? If I showed you these golden arches, what would that make you think of? McDonald's, right? They have these images or they have this slogan that is recognizable all over the world. Think about how you can create your branding to be memorable for your audience. Something that they resonate with. Something that they get a feeling about. I mean, I don't know about you but I think about Nike and I think about athleticism. I think about excellence. I think about hard work and determination and perseverance. I think about McDonald's and I think about Happy Meals. I loved Happy Meals as a kid. It made me happy. It was this fun experience with my brother, my little brother or my parents or my friends. You know, the birthday parties and the jungle gyms and stuff. It's a fun experience for me. What do you want your business to be about and how can you make sure that everything you put out on social media is aligned with that branding? The other piece of creating your branding is going to be the stories that you tell. So I recommend for every client that I ever work with. Or for anyone that ever listens to these videos to create a story inventory. Write that down. Story inventory. What is your story? You have multiple stories. You have your origin story of how you came to be who you are today. What was the thing that encouraged you to grow or start this business that you have? And what are the pivotal moments along the way that taught you lessons or shaped you into who you are today? I would actually recommend having a Google Doc or a huge notebook where you just brain dump all of your stories. This might be childhood lessons. It might be experiences with your family. It might be you discovering your expertise or your skills or what it was that encouraged you to start this business that you have today. And anytime you create a piece of content, you can go to your story inventory and share one of those stories in your content that people are going to resonate with. The reason why I urge you to tell stories in your content is because stories stand the test of time. Stories have been brought through from generations to generations. The things that carry on our culture or generations of wisdom is the stories that we tell and that we carry on. And as you tell these stories, people resonate with them. They're captivated. They move in closer. They want to hear them. Think about your favorite movies that you love to watch. You're following a storyline. You're connecting with the protagonist, the main character. You're on the edge of your seat watching them as they go through their trials and their tribulations. And by the end of the movie, why do you feel that adrenaline rush or sometimes that like, serotonin rush? Or dopamine hit that you just love this character that you've fallen in love with over the last hour and a half to two hours? Well, it's because you've watched their journey from start to finish. It's that you watch them hit rock bottom. You watch them climb their way up and because of that, you cheer louder when they win. Whether that means they got the girl or landed the dream job or won the race, you got to see what they went through. And you resonate with them. Whether you've been in the same experience or that you can relate to something similar that you've experienced. You can share that through your content. That's going to create this undeniable connection with your audience. You know, I see a lot of new businesses focus too much on fun facts and tidbits instead of going deep into the stories. When I first started my business, I was a social media manager and I was also a full-time dental hygienist. That was one of my first jobs is I was doing social media for the dental office I worked at. And sure, I could have made posts about how many times a day to brush your teeth and fun facts about cavities and fluoride and stuff. But that's not the stuff that makes you happy. That's not the stuff that makes you happy. That's not the stuff that makes people stop scrolling. That's not the stuff that captivates them and makes them think about it for days on end. The stuff that makes them stop what they're doing and pay attention is the story. So I would find stories from the people at our office or I would make up a funny story about our office goldfish. And that's the thing that gets a reaction. So think about that as you're creating your content. There's nothing wrong with sharing those fun facts and those tidbits. But can you tie it into a story that people will actually stop the scroll and pay attention to? Now, before I tell you about my proven tactics to landing your dream clients through social media, make sure that you hit that subscribe button. If you're an entrepreneur and you're looking to up level and grow and scale your business, make sure to subscribe because I'm putting out videos this every week. Okay, how to land your dream clients on social media. I have 3 tactics I'm going to share with you. The first one is a strong call to action at the end of every single video. Remember when I was giving the example about lead generation. Maybe I tell this really great story and I segue it into giving them the answer to that. If they click the link below. And they get the PDF or the e-book or they watch the next video or they sign up for a webinar. Whatever that thing is, that next step that I want them to take by telling them what to do by inviting them. That is a call to action. That's me saying, here's the next step that you can take to get more value from me. Click the link below. It's a strong call to action. When I first started creating content on social media, I didn't know what that was. I didn't know that I'm supposed to tell them what to do next. I think I kind of assumed like, well, if they the video. Maybe they'll subscribe or maybe they'll reach out to me. Maybe they'll email me. You can't assume that. Because they don't know that they're supposed to do that or they don't have a reason to. You have to give them a reason to act. So having a strong call to action telling them where to go. That's where you also get to actively pursue that relationship. It's being on a date with somebody. If you were on a date and you wanted to have that second date. I mean, sure you can play hard to get. But they might also be thinking, did that even go well? Do they me? Should this go anywhere? And then what if that's a misconnection? Instead, just ask for the second date. Ask them to take action. Click the link below. Join your email list and continue that relationship. Speaking of dating, the next concept that I love to share is know trust. Your audience to be able to take that action needs to know you, and trust you. And I use this dating analogy to create that image for you. That you're not just going right in for the proposal. You're nurturing your audience through this valuable content. So that when you do have that call to action. It's a no-brainer because they know you, they you, they trust you. If you didn't take the effort to date your audience. It would be the equivalent of someone coming up to you on the street and being like, hey, want to get married? You're like, I don't know you. You don't know my last name. You haven't taken me to dinner. You got to get to know your audience and they need to get to know you. And that's by creating valuable content. Now that's not to say that you can't have calls to action your content right from the get-go. But that you lead with value before you bring them to a call to action. And the way we do that is through the third tactic that I to call the 80-20 rule. Now this can be 80% and 20% in one piece of content or it can be 80-20 in your whole content structure. So an example is you know the post example that I gave you before where I told a story. And that's 80% of the post. And 20% of the post was the call to action. So I led with value. I told them a story that hopefully tugged at their heart strings or showed them the path and painted that picture of what life could be like. If they follow this strategy that I'm about to tell them when they click the link below. So having the 80-20 rule is going to be really important for building that know trust factor dating your audience and leading to the call to action in a way that isn't abrasive. going straight for the proposal. So remember all in all lead with lead generation, lead nurture, and lead conversion. When you have that in mind with every piece of content you create that's what's going to boost brand loyalty and sales. If you want to learn more about creating content that converts into cash flow and builds a raving audience for you. I have a training on just the thing. If you click the link below you can get free access to my next training. I'll see you there."
WcQDr4HxPKU.mp3,"The products are made in the factory, but brands are created in the mind. Even though we consider ourselves logical and modern human beings, the majority of our decisions are made by the ancient instinctive subconscious part of our brains, sometimes referred to as our reptilian brain. Let's have an insight into one such example in the field of marketing. In the 1970s, Japan's economy was booming, and Nestle was looking for the way to transform that into dollars. Obviously, the option they chose was coffee. But not so fast. It was no secret that Japanese consumers loved tea greatly. So Nestle tested the market cautiously before jumping in. They ran several focus groups, asking consumers from every age group what they thought of Nestle coffee. Surprisingly, everyone loved it. All focus group came back incredibly positive. Japanese consumers really liked the taste of coffee. Nestle executives got excited and they shifted into high gear, preparing a rollout plan to have coffee on every shelf in Japan. Huge sums were spent on marketing and distribution, and coffee hit the market with a huge amount of demand. And then… It wasn't as expected. Nestle coffee just wasn't selling in Japan. Is there anything more depressing than an empty coffee shop? It made no sense. Every study showed that Nestle coffee would be the next big thing, but Japanese consumers stuck to tea. Japanese consumers liked the taste of coffee but simply chose not to buy it. Faced with this challenging situation, Nestle decided to bring in the superstar of marketing, Claudia. The company's CEO, Claudia, was a famous coffee brand. She was known for her unique taste in coffee. She was known for her unique taste in coffee. She was known for her unique taste in coffee. She was known for her unique taste in coffee. She was known for her unique taste in coffee. She was known for her unique taste in coffee. She was known for her unique taste in coffee. She was known for her unique taste in coffee. Claudia who was known for her unique taste in coffee. Claudia was known a long time for coffeesimilar and there were many name recommendations regarding this Mazda name and theàpORA audiences were thinking of her as many as on the list in theérica�s stocks. An example of Clotter's work was with Jeep's latest models which hadn't been selling and the company couldn't understand why. Clotter came back with the oddest of suggestions. Go back to using round headlights. Clotter realized that for American consumers, a Jeep meant freedom. It was the symbol of Wild West, of running free and equivalent to horse. For Americans, the Jeep was the modern horse. When Jeep had changed their headlight shape from round to square, they had lost that connection because the headlights no longer looked a horse's eyes. Jeep changed it back and the sales went up unbelievably. Now back to Nestle in Japan. When Clotter arrived, he was quick to understand that Japanese consumers had no connection to coffee, no early childhood association. Japanese kids grew up watching their parents drink tea. They lived with the smell of tea in the air and ate tea-flavored snacks. Was it any surprise that, as adults, they chose tea over coffee? So, what did Clotter recommend? Yes. The coffee candies. Suddenly, hordes of Japanese kids began to discover the taste of coffee through dozens of different candy types. From there, they eventually moved on to cold sugary coffee-flavored drinks. And then to Latte's. And then. Before they knew it, big steamy mugs of Nescafe coffee. Not bad for a market that wouldn't buy coffee just 40 years ago. The key is, no matter what story you tell, make the buyer the hero. The key is, no matter what story you tell, make the buyer the hero. When the professed büyük fashion is sold, awaterm宮 metres deně pictures won't be in the machine, it's immediately the experience. Actually, they visited me, but there's no point, if they came to me and asked about what they were buying."

n6ecdYd8T6o.mp3,"How to write a business plan The thought of starting up a business can be an exciting time for many people. How to write a business plan is among the very first decisions you, as a future business owner, must make. Do you write it yourself, or give in to the temptation to take an easier path? By taking ownership of this first, most important step in building your business, you will gain far more than a crisp document to be read by others. You will develop a deep understanding of what it will take your business to succeed. For this reason, it is essential that the business owner will be the primary thought leader or sole author of the business plan. Wait, what is a business plan? Business plan is a researched and refined document that help you to get business loan, raise equity funding, can define and fix business objectives, get review of your business idea, agreements between partners, set a value on a business for sales, or legal purposes, evaluate a new product line, unique selling proposition, promotion and expansion. If you are approaching a banker for a loan for a startup business, your loan officer may suggest a small business administration loan, which will require a business plan. A business plan is simply a plan of what your goals are for the business, and how you plan to go about accomplishing them. Some people refer to it as a vision for your business. I to refer to it as a blueprint or a roadmap to accomplishing your goals. According to business experts, business plan will identify the purpose of your business, company description, business goals, structure, product or services, required resources, financial plan with financial statements, business management and operation. Now, the big question comes in our mind is… How to write a business plan? Experts agree that a business plan is crucial if you want to develop a strategy for your company. The size and niche of your operation does not matter. You need to learn how to write a business plan regardless. Let us explain 10 steps on how to write an effective business plan for your business. Step 1. Write an executive summary A poorly written executive summary is often the reason why you don't find investors for your business. No matter how qualified your team and you are, no matter how great the business idea. You should include in your executive summary all major information about your planned business in a concise, clear manner. Do not write your executive summary for yourself. Write it for your readers. Ask yourself who are those people? What's their educational backgrounds? What information really matters for them or what information is most likely to influence a positive decision? Limit the executive summary to one or three pages. Deliver a physically attractiveness and uniqueness. Clearly state what you expect from the investor. Simply state the returns and exit planned for the total project. Compellingly state the top two or three selling points of your investment proposition. Your executive summary doesn't require a full pro forma. Instead, give a simple statement of expected income, expenses, and anticipated income and cash flows. Finally, provide the total capital needed and a summary of the return projections. Step 2. Business Description A good business description will make your work a lot easier as you travel the road to starting your business. When you write a formal plan with the hope of qualifying for a business loan or attracting investors, you need to let them know that you know what you are doing. Your business description first and foremost must meet the expectations that your customers have when they walk through your doors. Get inside their heads. What do they want? If they are looking for something specific, you can bet there is something else related to it that they want as well. Understand them, offer what they want and then break it down what it will take to provide it. The business description section of a business plan should include information about the legal structure of a business, how the business came to be formed, the type of business, location of your business, types of business conducted , and what products and services you will provide to your customers and clients. Step 3 – Operations Plan Operational plan is a necessity of every new business to get good results. In order to write a operation plan, you need to include • Cash flow forecasting to project cash position of company • Profit plan preparation for future development • Flexible budget • Break-even analysis • Variance report to ensure control of expenses • Executive review daily, weekly, and monthly • Management meeting • Weekly position report for company • Mission statement • Strategic team operating plan • Organization structure • Delegation of authority to outline the principles • Position guide development • Hiring procedure • Performance evaluations • Progressive discipline • Employee compensation • Profit-based incentive system Operation plan is simply a- A technique of probing into the present and past performance of an operational investment. It measures the performance against particular standard costs, operations and services. It also considers how goals can be achieved in a better way, how cost-effectively they can be achieved. Step 4 – Organization and Management Organizational structure – Details about the ownership of the company, who is part of the management team and who are the board members. In addition to who the board members are, you will need to describe why they were chosen to be a part of the board. Here you should include a chart describing the organizational structure, which includes the managers, employees and other important point persons of the business. Within this organizational chart, each managerial position should list the name of the person, the position, primary responsibilities, education, who they manage, special skills, number of years with the company, and the company's position. Step 5 – Legal structure of your business There are four legal structures and it depends on you as to which one you would for your new business. 1. Sole proprietorship This is the kind of business structure that has only one owner, which in this case, is you. You decide on things, you have the last say on everything. 2. Partnerships Two or more owners of the same business may file for partnership status. This type of business structure is very similar to the sole proprietorship. All partners are held financially responsible for the debts of the business and tax burden is borne proportionally by the partners. 3. A corporation Corporations can have many structures. But the most typical corporation organizational structure consists of the one board of directors, two officers, three employees, and four shareholders or owners. There is no limit. 1. A corporation can have as many as are desirable or expedient to do business. 4. Limited liability corporations a corporation, a limited liability company or LLC is a separate and distinct legal entity. This means that an LLC can get a tax identification number, open a bank account and do business, all under its own name. Step 6 – Products and services Using a business plan to outline what products will be produced or sold. Or what services will be provided. What services are offered is a wonderful way to communicate information to others. This section should highlight biggest sellers, unique products or services that your business provides and give a description about your items. This section will show the heart of your business, and what you are offering to the public. Step 7 – Marketing and sales strategy By developing a marketing and sales strategy, you understand the type of clients you are going for by developing a strategy to approach those clients to buy your products or services. You must understand your demographics so you can develop a proper strategy that will work. If you are a real estate agent, your target would be anyone that's selling or buying a home. That's your demographics. You would plan your strategy based on areas where buying and selling homes are active. There are four things to add into your sales and marketing strategy. 1. Write your sales and marketing goals and milestones per month or year. 2. You should plan your sales and marketing goals and milestones per month or year. 3. You should plan your sales and marketing goals and milestones per month or year. 2. Define your target customer profiles and your marketing strategies. What forms of communication do you plan to use to market to customers? Print, radio, internet or viral campaigns – all forms of advertising should be discussed in depth. 3. Set up success-orientated revenue targets. 4. Develop an action plan to implement your sales and marketing strategy. Step 8 – Competitive analysis. Do competitive analysis to perform better. Competitive analysis can depend on four major factors. 1. Categorizing the competitors. It is necessary for the management to categorize the top ten companies in the market who seem stronger and larger than their company. 2. Analyzing their promotional strategy. Competitors these days utilize hundreds of ways to promote their products or services. The management needs to get deep into these promotional strategies of top ten companies. 3. Competitors' products analysis. The management needs to evaluate the competitors' products and services from different aspects product features, product values, and targets taken by the competitors. 4. Competitors' advantageous aspects. Once the competitors are categorized, the management can start to evaluate their strategies and spot the most vulnerable. Step 9. Comprehensive analysis. The management needs to be able to assess the most vulnerable areas of the competitors. This can be done through an assessment of the competitors' weaknesses and strengths. The best method for understanding competitors' weaknesses and strengths is implementing SWOT analysis. A SWOT represents strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. It is a tool used to provide a general or detailed snapshot of a company's health. Write about competitors' strengths. Is there any future possibilities to beat your competitors? Also, write down threats of your competitors legal issues, business policies and other personal issues. Step 9. Unique selling proposition. So what is your unique selling proposition? What differentiates your offering to the marketplace? What combination of features will your customers find benefit them more than your competitors' offerings? Step 10. Unique selling proposition. Can you deliver complete orders faster than your competitors? Can you deliver orders faster than your competitors? Allowing your customers to keep less inventory? If you're in financial services or real estate, do you have some special education or experience that your clients would find valuable if they knew about it? Do you have so much confidence in your product or service that you can offer your customers a performance guarantee others can't or won't match? Can your customers call in and speak with the real human being on the fourth ring? Can you deliver complete orders faster than your competitors? fourth ring, or better 98% of the time? Making working with your business an exceptionally pleasant experience? You get the idea. Write down USP for your product or services. And Step 10 – Financial Plan Financial planning is paramount to the success of any company, whether that business is just starting up or well-established. The first steps to business finance startup are to determine and estimate the amount of funds needed to open a business. These startup expenses may include one-time fees, such as permits and licenses needed to operate the business. Initial costs may also include ongoing fees, such as rent and utility payments. Business owners usually only include the necessary expenses when determining the total cost to start up. In order to estimate the amount of funds needed for the business, owners should set up worksheets that list each of the following requirements. The first step is to determine the amount of funds needed to start a business. The second step is to determine the amount of funds needed to start a business. The third step is to determine the amount of funds needed to start a business. This waste may be estimated as much as the cost of operating a business or the amount of money needed to start a business. The fourth step is to determine the amount of funds needed to start a business. Make your business plan clear and concise where appropriate. And always be thinking of a WHAT IF situation in every part of the plan – after all, the reader will be. If you answer the question before it can be asked, that's the best way to convincing your audience that you are serious, realistic and can adapt and overcome. Let your business plan become the blueprint that you can work to in the first 12 months of your business.
