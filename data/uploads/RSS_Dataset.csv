Coinbase becomes Ethereum&#039;s largest node operator with 11% stake,https://cointelegraph.com/news/coinbase-largest-ethereum-node-operator-11-percent-staked-eth?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound," Coinbase is Ethereum’s largest node operator, holding 11.42% of staked ETH with validators achieving 99.75% uptime, outperforming network averages.  A Coinbase report revealed that the crypto exchange is the largest node operator on the Ethereum network, controlling 11.42% of the total staked Ether. In a performance report, Coinbase said it had 3.84 million Ether (ETH), worth about $6.8 billion, staked to its validators. The exchange said that, as of March 3, it has 11.42% of the total staked ETH.  Anthony Sassano, host of The Daily Gwei, said that Coinbase's stake makes the exchange the “single largest node operator” in the network.  Sassano added that while the staking platform Lido is bigger as a collective, each node operator has a much smaller percentage share.  Source: Anthony Sassano Related: 83% of institutions plan to up crypto allocations in 2025: Coinbase Coinbase also shared that it exceeded its target for validator uptime, which indicates the percentage of time when validators are operational. It also had a similar figure for its participation rate, a metric that indicates how well validators perform their consensus duties. Coinbase also reported that its validators had an average uptime of 99.75%. Coinbase said they outperformed their target of 99% uptime without compromising security standards.  The exchange attributed the performance to an upgrade implemented in 2024, which allowed the exchange to keep validators running while performing beacon node maintenance.  Meanwhile, Coinbase validators’ participation rate is also at 99.75%. This exceeds the network average of 99.52%. In addition, the Coinbase average for signing and submitting blocks produced by their MEV relays is 99.76%, higher than the network average of 99.38%.  While Coinbase operates a centralized exchange platform, the company said it distributes its validators across several regions to “help maintain a truly distributed and decentralized Ethereum blockchain.” The exchange said its validators operate in Japan, Singapore, Ireland, Germany and Hong Kong.  Coinbase validator average performance versus Ethereum network averages.

Why is Bitcoin price up today?,https://cointelegraph.com/news/why-is-bitcoin-price-up-today?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound," Bitcoin jumped as markets reacted to the Fed’s dovish signals and rising BTC accumulation by long-term holders.

Rising BTC supply among long-term holders’ addresses. Bitcoin rose as the Federal Reserve signaled it still expects to cut interest rates twice later this year, easing investor concerns over prolonged monetary tightening. Key takeaways from the Federal Open Market Committee’s meeting on March 19: The Fed kept its benchmark rate on hold while acknowledging that tariff-driven inflation pressures may be “transitory.” Chair Jerome Powell’s measured tone on recession risk, stating it was ""not high,"" reassured risk-on investors. The Fed trimmed its growth forecast, fueling a bond rally and reinforcing expectations of lower borrowing costs in the future. US 2-year and 10-year Treasury note yields daily chart.

A decisive pullback may lead the pair initially toward the 50-4H EMA at around $83,900. A further correction could have it test the channel’s lower boundary as support, aligning with $82,400, which served as support between March 16 and March 17.

Bitcoin price tags 2-week highs as markets bet big on Trump crypto news,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-2-week-highs-markets-bet-big-trump-crypto-news?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound," Bitcoin sees some much-needed relief thanks to a combination of Fed policy confirmation and rumors of a ""significant update"" to US crypto plans.  Bitcoin (BTC) spiked to two-week highs on March 20 amid rumors that the US government was preparing a “major update” to its crypto policy. BTC/USD 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD reaching nearly $87,500 on Bitstamp. Currently consolidating near $86,000, Bitcoin benefitted from a fairly cool Federal Reserve meeting the day prior in which officials opted to hold interest rates at current levels. Policymakers confirmed that they envisage two cuts by the end of 2025, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell describing inflation as having “eased significantly.” “We do not need to be in a hurry to adjust our policy stance, and we are well positioned to wait for greater clarity,” he said in an opening statement before a press conference that followed the rates decision. A “wait-and-see” approach was enough to relieve troubled risk assets, with Bitcoin joining US stocks in surging and finishing the day higher. The S&P 500 ended up by around 1% for the March 20 session, adding $500 billion in market cap. Reacting, Arthur Hayes, former CEO of crypto exchange BitMEX, suggested that the Fed had delivered a key signal for traders to add risk. “JAYPOW delivered, QT basically over Apr 1.

$77K likely the Bitcoin bottom as QT is ‘effectively dead’ — Analysts,https://cointelegraph.com/news/arthur-hayes-calls-bitcoin-price-77k-bottom-analysts-qt-dead?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound," The Fed’s quantitative tightening is “basically over,” which has crypto analysts feeling slightly more bullish about its implications for the crypto market.  Bitcoin is unlikely to revisit the $77,000 price level anytime soon after the Fed signaled a slowdown in quantitative tightening (QT), says BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes. On March 10, Bitcoin (BTC) dipped near the $77,000 level for the first time since November, according to CoinMarketCap data. “Was BTC $77k the bottom, prob,” Hayes said in a March 20 X post after declaring that QT is “basically over” following the Fed’s March 19 announcement that starting in April, it will slow its securities sell-off by reducing the monthly Treasury cap from $25 billion to $5 billion.  Bitcoin is up 3.53% over the past seven days. Source: CoinMarketCap This could ease liquidity pressures and support risk assets like Bitcoin, as QT involves central banks selling assets to reduce the money supply and possibly raise interest rates.  “The next thing we need to get bulled up for realz is either SLR exemption and or a restart of QE,” Hayes added. The Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR) exemption was a temporary rule during the COVID-19 pandemic that allowed banks to exclude US Treasury securities from their SLR calculations. Meanwhile, quantitative easing (QE) is a monetary policy that aims to stimulate the economy and encourage more spending. Echoing a similar sentiment to Hayes, Real Vision chief crypto analyst Jamie Coutts said in a March 19 X post that “QT is effectively dead.” Coutts explained that “treasury volatility” has calmed down following the US dollar's drop earlier this month, a positive signal for boosting liquidity. Other optimists included Axie Infinity co-founder Jeff “JiHo” Zirlin, who said the Fed slowdown is “great for both crypto and equity markets.” “The Fed has significant leeway to loosen up, providing more support for businesses + markets,” Zirlin said, while Bitcoin venture capitalist Mark Moss said that with QT ending, “the dam is going to break.” Related: Bitcoin risks new 'death cross’ as BTC price tackles $84K resistance Meanwhile, crypto market sentiment has spiked following the Fed’s comments.  The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, which tracks overall sentiment, has moved into “Neutral” territory at 49 after lingering in the “Fear” area since Feb. 26. Despite Bitcoin being down nearly 22% from its January $109,000 all-time highs, Infinex founder Kain Warwick told Cointelegraph that it is a “normal mid-bull correction.” “I would need to see a much larger breakdown to flip bearish,” Warwick said. “My baseline thesis is the four-year cycle holds once again, which means we keep grinding up through the rest of the year.” Magazine: Classic Sega, Atari and Nintendo games get crypto makeovers: Web3 Gamer This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

US recession would be a big catalyst for Bitcoin: BlackRock,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-benefit-us-recession-blackrock-crypto-head?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound," Bitcoin would be a big winner from a potential US recession as it’s built to thrive in a high fiscal spending, low interest rate environment, says a BlackRock executive.  BlackRock’s head of digital assets, Robbie Mitchnick, says that Bitcoin will most likely thrive in a recessionary macro environment, contrary to what some analysts may think.  “I don’t know if we’ll have a recession or not, but a recession would be a big catalyst for Bitcoin,” Mitchnick said in a March 19 interview with Yahoo Finance.Mitchnick said Bitcoin (BTC) is catalyzed by increased fiscal spending, deficit accumulation, lower interest rates and monetary stimulus — all of which tend to happen in recessions. “And it’s catalyzed to some extent over fears of general social disorder,” Mitchnick pointed out. “And that too, unfortunately, is something that can happen in a recession.” 🚨 LATEST: BlackRock Global Head of Digital Assets Robbie Mitchnick says, “If you look at Bitcoin fundamentally on a long-term basis, it really seems like an asset that should be uncorrelated or even inversely correlated against certain risk factors that exist.” pic.twitter.com/bC0zKqF3xB The BlackRock executive said the market is “not particularly well calibrated” to Bitcoin, and many still view it as a risk-on asset. Risk-on assets, such as stocks, commodities and high-yield bonds, tend to suffer during times of economic crises, but Mitchnick said in September that he believed the asset was mislabeled.  Mitchnick said BlackRock has been helping some of its clients see through some of these conflicting narratives. He added that some of BlackRock’s more “sophisticated long-term Bitcoin accumulator” clients see the market correction as a buying opportunity and aren’t bothered by the current economic headwinds. Meanwhile, researchers from cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase were less bullish, saying crypto’s positive outlook for the first quarter had “clearly been misplaced” by recession fears and the recent tariffs imposed. “Fears of a dramatic US economic slowdown or even recession have caused sentiment to turn sharply,” Coinbase Institutional said in its monthly outlook report on March 17. Related: Crypto market’s biggest risks in 2025: US recession, circular crypto economy BlackRock has played a key role in the institutional and wealth advisory adoption of Bitcoin through its iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF — which holds the most net assets of any Bitcoin investment product at $48.7 billion.

Bitcoin long-term holder behavior shift signals &#039;unique market dynamic&#039; — Research,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-unique-market-dynamic-long-term-holders?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound," Bitcoin long-term holders continued to hold profits despite BTC prices dropping to a four-month low, indicating a strong belief that the bull market rally would eventually resume.  Bitcoin’s corrective phase set a four-month low at $76,600 on March 11. Despite this decline, long-term holders have continued to hold large amounts of BTC, suggesting a “unique market dynamic moving forward,” new research says.  “Long-Term Holder activity remains largely subdued, with a notable decline in their sell-side pressure,” Glassnode said in a March 18 markets report. Bitcoin’s recovery comes as selling pressure among Long-Term Holders (LTHs) — wallets that have held Bitcoin for at least 155 days — begins to wane.  The Binary Spending Indicator, a metric used to determine when LTHs are spending a significant proportion of their holdings in a sustained manner, shows a slowdown (see chart below) while the LTH supply is also beginning to rebound after several months of decline. “This suggests that there is a greater willingness to hold than to spend coins among this cohort,” Glassnode noted, adding: Bitcoin: LTH spending binary indicator. Source: Glassnode Bull market tops are often marked by intense sell-side pressure and strong profit-taking among LTHs, which signals a complete shift to bearish behavior.  However, despite Bitcoin's drawdown in recent weeks, this investor cohort continues to hold a large portion of their profits, especially for this later stage of the cycle, Glassnode said.  This could suggest that long-term holders may still be expecting more BTC price upside later in the year. Bitcoin: Cumulative LTH realized profit.

"Bitcoin Traders Seek Topside Option Plays After Powell's Transitory Inflation Remark, Ether Still Lags in Sentiment",https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/03/20/bitcoin-traders-seek-topside-option-plays-after-powell-s-transitory-inflation-remark-ether-still-lags-in-sentiment,"Bitcoin (BTC) punters are looking at topside options bets in a bullish shift in price expectations after the Federal Reserve's (Fed) meeting, but ether (ETH) continues to lag sentiment.  As of writing, BTC's short-term and long-term risk reversals, which show the implied volatility premium (demand) for bullish bets or calls versus puts, were positive, implying investor interest in chasing price gains in the leading cryptocurrency, per data source Amberdata. It marks a shift from the bearish sentiment that prevailed weeks before the Fed meeting when short and near-dated puts were pricier than calls, reflecting downside fears. ""Frontend skew flipped calls. Flows featured 21 Mar outright calls and calendars bought, while 28 Mar puts were sold,"" institution-focused over-the-counter tech platform Paradigm noted in the Telegram chat. Institutions and large traders execute block trades via OTC platforms like Paradigm, which are then listed on Deribit. Options are derivative contracts that give the purchaser the right but not the obligation to purchase or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price at a later date. A call option gives the right to buy, and a put option gives the right to sell. The bullish shift in the short and near-dated options happened as the Federal Reserve (Fed) retained the forecast for two rate cuts this year despite making the expected stagflationary adjustment in economic forecasts. The bank said it will slow the pace of balance sheet run off from April.  More importantly, Chairman Jerome Powell downplayed fears about the inflationary impact of Trump's tariffs, calling it transitory. Additionally, the end of the prolonged legal tussle between the SEC and Ripple, which uses XRP for cross border transactions, likely aided the sentiment. XRP, with the market cap of $142.21 billion, is the world's fourth largest cryptocurrency.  These positive developments, however, are yet to translate into a positive flip in the short and near-dated ether options.

The CoinDesk 20 — an index of the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization except for stablecoins, memecoins and exchange coins — is up 6%. Ether (ETH) and solana (SOL) have both surged by 7%, while Ripple’s XRP token has risen 10% off the back of CEO Brad Garlinghouse’s announcement that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is planning to drop its case against the company. Crypto stocks are also doing relatively well, especially bitcoin mining companies like Bitdeer (BTDR) and Core Scientific (CORZ), which are up 10% and 8% on the day, respectively. Bitdeer is likely buoyed from the technological progress it recently made in its ASIC manufacturing process, as well as from the news that stablecoin giant Tether was increasing its stake in the company to 21%. Core Scientific, meanwhile, is potentially reaping the benefits of AI firm CoreWeave (Core Scientific’s main customer) filing for an initial public offering earlier in the month. Even so, both companies are down more than 61% and 53% since January and November respectively. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said that tariff-related inflation was likely to be transitory and that recession risks remained low. And despite the market reacting positively to the meeting — Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones all gained 1% or more — market commentators weren’t necessarily convinced. “The word — ‘transitory’ — is back at the Federal Reserve as Chair Powell characterizes the price effects of tariffs as a one-off,” economist Mohamed A. El-Erian posted on X. “I would have thought that, particularly after the big policy mistake of earlier this decade and given all the current uncertainties, some Fed officials would show greater humility. It’s simply too early to say with any regress of confidence that the inflationary effects will be transitory.” Gold continued to rise after surpassing the $3,000 mark on Tuesday and today hit a new record above $3,050. Callie Cox, chief market strategist at Ritholtz Wealth Management, said that the U.S. central bank was signaling that any additional rate cuts would likely happen at the cost of battering stocks. “The Fed is no longer comfortable gliding to neutral as we get closer to their inflation target.

Pectra will go live on Hoodi on March 26, and if all goes well, the long-awaited upgrade will proceed to Ethereum's mainnet roughly 30 days later, according to the network's core developers. Hoodi was created following faulty Pectra tests on Ethereum’s other testnets, Holesky and Sepolia, which failed to finalize properly due to problems with how they were configured. Test networks like Holesky, Sepolia, and Hoodi aim to mimic the main Ethereum network — allowing developers the opportunity to test out code changes or major upgrades like Pectra in a low-stakes environment before deploying them to the mainnet. — Margaux Nijkerk Read more.

Ethereum to Sunset ‘Holesky’ Testnet in September,https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2025/03/19/ethereum-to-sunset-holesky-testnet-in-september,"Ethereum is set to discontinue its largest test network, Holesky, after it encountered challenges testing the forthcoming Pectra upgrade.  The Ethereum Foundation (EF) said in a blog post on Tuesday that the network — a controlled environment for testing Ethereum infrastructure and upgrades — will begin winding down, with a full shutdown anticipated on Sept. 30. The just-launched Hoodi test network, deployed on Monday, will serve as Holesky's replacement.  The deprecation plan comes after Holesky fell offline due to February's faulty test of Ethereum’s upcoming Pectra update. Developers took weeks to recover Holesky, which came back online in March but suffered from residual damage — so-called ""inactivity leaks"" that clogged up Holesky's entire validator apparatus.  “[E]xited validators would take approximately one year to fully be removed from the validator set,” the EF explained in their blog post. “The size of the exit queue prevents Holesky from being used to test the full validator lifecycle within a reasonable timeframe.”  Ethereum runs testnets so that developers can run code changes before bringing them to Ethereum’s main network (mainnet). Test networks essentially replicate the Ethereum mainnet, and they allow developer teams and infrastructure providers to test out new software before launching them in a more high-stakes environment.  Holesky was specifically intended for testing by Ethereum's validator ecosystem — the stakers and node operators that keep the Ethereum network up and running. It was built to model close-to-real network conditions with its support for a giant 1.4 million validators — more than Goerli, which Holesky replaced in 2023, and even the real Ethereum network.  Currently, Holesky is used by validators and staking providers, but the similarly-constructed Hoodi network will serve that function moving forward. Hoodi went live earlier this week and plans to test the Pectra upgrade on March 26. Should that test proceed smoothly, developers intend to push Pectra onto Ethereum’s mainnet 30 days later.  “Stakers, this is your new testing ground,” said Tim Beiko, the protocol support lead at the EF, in a post on X.

"Bitcoin, Ether, Solana Likely to See 3%- 5% Price Swings on FOMC Rate Decision, Volmex's Data Suggests",https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/03/19/bitcoin-ether-and-solana-likely-to-see-3-5-price-swings-on-fomc-rate-decision-volmex-s-data-suggests,"The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the U.S. Federal Reserve's monetary policy-making body, is slated to publish its rate review later in the day, along with growth and inflation projections and interest rate forecast. The widely-watched event is likely to breed crypto market volatility, spurring 3% to 5% price swings in bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and solana (SOL). That's the message from Volmex's one-day implied volatility indices tied to BTC, ETH and SOL. At 12:30 UTC, the bitcoin one-day IV index (BVIV) signaled an annualized volatility of 63.32%, equating to an expected 24-hour price swing of 3.31%. The daily move is calculated by dividing the annualized figure by the square root of 365, the total number of trading days in a year. Similarly, ether and solana volatility indices suggested 24-hour price swings of 5.25% and 5.73%, respectively. These figures might be scary for equity or currency traders but do not represent a major deviation from the normal in the crypto market. In other words, the Fed event, though pivotal, is unlikely to result in an immediate volatility explosion. The central bank is widely expected to keep the benchmark borrowing cost steady while signaling an end of its prolonged quantitive tightening program. However, gains in risk assets may be tempered by a potential stagflationary adjustment in the summary of economic projections.

Blockdaemon Acquires DeFi Connectivity Firm Expand to Bring Institutions to Web3,https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/03/19/blockdaemon-acquires-defi-connectivity-firm-expand-to-bring-institutions-to-web3,"Blockdaemon, a leading provider of crypto infrastructure, has acquired expand.network, a single API connection into the multifarious world of decentralized finance (DeFi), with a view to enabling big financial institutions to seamlessly access on-chain trading. The exact price paid for expand.network was not revealed, but Blockdaemon said the deal was worth double digit millions of dollars. The firm provides API access to DeFi, enabling connections to over 170 endpoints, including DEXs, bridges, lending protocols and oracles. As long-awaited regulatory clarity comes to crypto in the U.S., banks and large financial institutions are considering a point of entry into the on-chain finance world. Blockdaemon, which counts banks like Goldman Sachs among its backers, assists around 70% of top 500 institutions active in crypto, which includes running over 250,000 nodes across 40 data centers, as well as handling staking rewards, and more recently establishing cross-blockchain, self-custody wallet offerings for big players. The next logical step for banks and institutions is providing easy access via Blockdaemon’s interoperable, staking-ready wallets into the complex realm of DeFi lending, borrowing and automated liquidity, said Konstantin Richter, founder and CEO of Blockdaemon. “DeFi will make running financial infrastructure a lot cheaper for banks and institutions and it’s where a lot of institutional benefits will reside over time,” Richter said in an interview. “It's still very early and obviously there's a lot that still needs to happen in terms of regulatory clarity, adoption and decentralization. But the time is right to accelerate that particular vertical within our product suite.” UPDATE (March, 19, 13:10 UTC): changes from Expand to expand.network  Ian Allison is a senior reporter at CoinDesk, focused on institutional and enterprise adoption of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.

"Erdogan Rival's Arrest Sends Lira to Record Low, Bitcoin-TRY Volume Surging on Binance",https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/03/19/turkish-lira-crashes-to-record-low-spurring-volume-surge-in-binance-s-bitcoin-lira-pair,"The Turkish lira (TRY) fell to a record low against the dollar following the surprise arrest of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's rival and Istanbul mayor Ekrem Imamoglu. The currency slumped a record of nearly 41 per U.S. dollar, a 10% slide on the day. The volatility saw a sharp rise in trading volumes in the bitcoin-lira (BTC/TRY) pair on leading cryptocurrency exchange Binance. Imamoglu's Republican People’s Party (CHP) described the arrest as a coup to replace the will of the people. The party was set to hold a primary election next week, with Imamoglu widely expected to emerge as the presidential candidate. On Binance, the BTC/TRY pair saw 93 BTC change hands between 7:00 UTC and 8:00 UTC, according to data source TradingView. That's the highest hourly volume in at least a year. Still, when adjusted for the lira's exchange rate, BTC traded at a massive discount to prices on Coinbase (COIN).  It's possible traders sold BTC/TRY to move money into dollar-linked assets like USDT, the largest stablecoin. CoinDesk reached out to Binance for a comment on the matter. Fiat-currency volatility is not new to Turkey and over the years it has galvanized demand for hard assets like gold and alternative assets like stablecoins and cryptocurrencies. The lira has consistently depreciated since at least 2017, when it 3.53 to the dollar.
