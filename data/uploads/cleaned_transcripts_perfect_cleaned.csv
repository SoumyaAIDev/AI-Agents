Today I want to share with you seven marketing secrets or marketing hacks or marketing tricks. Essentially things that nobodys talking about, not even me that often. And its because theyre a little more complicated and a little more nuanced than the quick hits that we often get when it comes to social media. Things post it this time or adapt your content for this algorithm tweak or use this kind of font or this kind of color or all of those things. What Id rather do is get to the core of why your marketing may not be working as as you want. And even if it is working okay, understanding the seven things Im going to be walking you through here today will allow you to immediately upgrade all of it. Get better results, more clicks, more traffic, more sales from everything you do. And not only that, probably the most important thing that I could ever give you is to show you how to think about your marketing, how to process different marketing strategies. And the crazy stuff that goes on inside my head when Im evaluating different marketing tactics and tools and resources and all of that. my goal here today is as ambitious as it is, is to try to pack seven secrets and seven hacks into a very short period of time that youre going to be able to watch this and youre going to be able to extract these little golden nuggets and apply them to your business, to your clients business, to whatever it is that youre doing. And it starts now. the very first thing that we need to talk about is kind of the first thing that we need to talk about is kind of what ends up happening when someone says, Hey, my marketings not working. its nothings happening. No ones clicking. No ones watching my stuff. The algorithm isnt pushing it or promoting it to people. Nothings working. Its something that I hear all the time. I see it in the comments below. Very common. 90 of the time its because theyre not doing enough marketing. Its a question of volume. Its a question of quantity, not much quality. let me explain. I dont know for this one. Maybe its the get rich quick things. Maybe its the, uh, all of the courses and the programs that promise that you can become a millionaire in 30 days with no work or whatever it is. But for some reason, when people think about marketing, they think that all they need to do is make a Facebook ad or an Instagram ad or post one video on YouTube and theyll blow up and become the next viral sensation and everything will work out miraculously well. And I seriously, I wish this was the case. Thatd be amazing, but its not right. Its marketing is a business function. Im going to make this sound horribly boring, but its accounting or finance or legal aspects of a business or HR or sales or whatever it is. Theyre all different business functions, which means that they require time. They require energy. They require money and investment in them in order to get them to work. Now, what ends up happening is most people will make one post on social media. It wont get the traction and then theyll swear off that platform. theyll hop over here, try out Twitter now and make a couple of tweets. Nobody engages. they will get frustrated and theyll get angry because its not working when the reality is they probably havent done enough. And thats why the first concept, the first sort of hack or secret is identifying the marketing sweet spot. in the most rudimentary art drawing class ever, let me show you exactly what I mean by marketing sweet spot. And you can see where you fall and where the vast majority of businesses fall. And if you find yourself in this position, you know that the answer is to keep on pushing through. Its not to dial back, its not to pivot, its not to do anything that. Its to keep going forward. let me show you what that looks like. I want you to imagine for a second, a bell curve, kind of the traditional bell curve. Of course, thatll be the, there we go. Well get some ink flowing here. this is our bell curve, our ugly, ugly bell curve. And its going to have three, three different sections. Now over here on the left, this is what youre going to call the minimum effective dose. the MED, the minimum effective dose, essentially what happens is youre going to have a minimum effective dose of 5. And what ends up happening here is until youre in this range, nothing you do matters. Its about sort of making that one post on social media that someone sees one time and then thats it. And then you wonder why its not working. Its about spending a 5 on Facebook ads or Instagram ads and not getting immediate sales and then sort of swearing off the entire online advertising system and that. But the reality is we havent hit the minimum effective dose. Theres not enough momentum. Theres not enough exposure. Theres not enough reach and engagement with the audience that youre trying to reach. And were going to talk about that one in a second. But this is where 90 of businesses fall as they sit around here in this minimum effective dose, kind of half committing to different strategies and then wondering why nothings working. And the answer here, the solution is again, youve got to push through. Youve got to move up here. And this is the sweet spot. This is where youre going to find sort of the saturation of your market. Youre going to be hitting the number of times youve hit the minimum effective dose. Youre going to be hitting the number of times youve hit the minimum effective dose. Youre going to be hitting the number of times youve hit the minimum effective dose. Youre going to be hitting points that are required. Again, well talk about that in a second. Youre going to be making sure that the people that you want to reach are seeing your content. Youre going to make sure that youve essentially saturated everything that you can. Now, the reality is this sweet spot is huge, massive, massively huge. when were thinking about your business, your market, or your industry, these are huge, huge industries, billions and billions of dollars. unless your business is doing a billion dollars a year or more, theres more that you can do. Its crazy when I hear about something this, and Im like, oh, my God, Im going to be that. Well, look, Im already posting once a day on Instagram, or Im already making one YouTube video a week, or Ive got a podcast. Im pretty much maxed out. Theres nothing else I can do. And theyre sitting at, I dont know, say a million bucks a year. And theyre in, lets use health and fitness. if youre in, lets say, the health and fitness industry, this massive multibillion dollar industry, and your business is doing a million a year, two million a year, a hundred grand a year, whatever it is, you havent even scratched the surface for what youre capable of doing and for the amount of people that you could reach. you could go from one post a day to five a day. You could go from one post a day to five a day. You could go from one post a day to five posts a day. You could make one video on YouTube to a week to one video on YouTube a day. You could do two videos a day. You could start other channels. You could have other podcasts. Theres much that you can do. Now, of course, at some point, youre going to reach this third area, which is diminishing returns. Diminishing returns. There we go. D for diminishing. Diminishing returns. Theres going to be some point where eventually more money, more effort, more time isnt going to pay off. But I cant even begin to tell you of all of the businesses Ive worked with over the last 10 years, the tiniest fraction falls in here. And typically its when theyre spending a million dollars a month on ads and they simply cant get in front of more people with their ads. theyre doing blogging. Theyre doing podcasting. Theyre doing SEO. Theyre running Google ads and Facebook ads and Instagram ads and all that. The biggest example here is if youre running some kind of searchbased PPC payperclick advertising, a Google search ad. At the end of the day, you cant make people search for more stuff. you cant make people search for more stuff. you cant make people search for more stuff. you cant make people search for more stuff. you cant make people max out. But again, you can make that broader. You can go for discovery ad platforms Facebook and Instagram, where you can put things in front of people that may potentially be interested. Theres a lot of ways. the reality is lets find a bright, happy, colorful marker. This is where were going for. This sweet spot here. everybody is down here in this sort of minimum effective dose. They havent even scratched the surface for whats possible. And then theyre wondering why their marketing is not working. The biggest, the best piece of advice of everything that I could give you here is really, you have to do more. Now, of course you need to be strategic. You need to think through it. Thats what the rest of this is going to be about, but more is your answer. on that note, how much more? And that leads me to the marketing rule of seven. Now, depending on your business or market or your industry, depending on if youre selling something for low dollar value or high dollar value, its kind of universally agreed that for somebody to make a purchase decision, for someone to take action and buy from you, they need around seven touch points, which means seven engagements, seven interactions, with your brand. You cant simply put something in front of them one time, expect them to buy, and then call it a day. Youre going to have to do this multiple times. Seven. Now, if its expensive, its going to be seven to 14. If its significantly cheaper, youre selling a pack of gum for 99 cents or something, you probably dont need seven touch points. One should be sufficient. But that rule of seven is important because it forces you to not give up too early. Its when youre looking at the statistics around sales and you realize that most conversions, most closes for sales happen after five rejections or five followups, five emails, five extra calls. Its rarely, if pretty much never, the first time. Same thing goes with marketing. Bit of a side note here, but marketing is kind of selling one to many. Sales one to one, marketing one to many. we use the same concepts, the same strategies, all of that with sales. But I to think of marketing as a little more exciting and a little more challenging even because instead of trying to convince one person at a time and overcome their objections and their concerns, we have to do this en masse and we have to do it without getting much feedback from our market. rule of seven, thats important. Now, how do we do this? Well, we do this by showing up in front of our ideal target market where theyre present and active, which means that we need to be selective about what social media platforms were going to, about what kind of content were creating, about where were putting that. We need to make sure that its in alignment, not only with you and your content style and what you doing and hate doing, but also where your people are. In fact, thats the most important element. Theres no point on being on Twitter or Pinterest or TikTok or Instagram or YouTube if your people arent there. youve got to find out where theyre present and active online, and then youve got to make it your mission to follow up and to make sure that youre consistently showing up in front of them with value, with content, and with offers. thats the marketing rule of seven. Now, the next point is more of a psychological phenomenon, more of a mental hack that you can use. Ive talked about this a ton on this channel here, but its called the mirror exposure effect. And what the mirror exposure effect is, its a psychological phenomenon that says we as people, as humans, we associate frequency with trust. the more often that we show up in front of people, the more often that they see us, the more they know us, the more they us, and the more that they trust us. This kind of stems back to caveman days where if we saw something enough times and it didnt try to kill us or eat us, we assumed it was safe. Well, all of that programming, all of that evolution is carried forward to today. now when we see things again and again and again, we naturally start to things more because were familiar with them. Theyre less scary. Theyre less scary. Theyre less scary. And therefore were more likely to trust them. this is why that marketing rule of seven is important. This is why following up is important. This is why making sure that youve got a solid email marketing strategy in place is paramount. Its crucial. Probably the second most important thing I could offer here, if the first one is to make sure that you get out of that minimum effective dose zone and into the sweet spot by doing more. The second, probably most valuable piece of advice I could give you is to make sure that youre doing some kind of email marketing and youre doing it more than you think. And thats the third reason. Theres this rule, this gospel in the marketing world that you should send one marketing email a week at most, maybe one a month, because you dont want to bother people. Garbage. Its absolute garbage. Theres plenty of businesses and industries where you could send one email every three days. You could send one email a day. Theres some businesses and companies that Ive consulted for and done work with and own and have a stake in that do two emails a day. And it works. People dont get angry. They dont subscribe. Youve got to know who youre marketing to. And thats the third reason. Theres this rule, this rule that you should be shooting for three emails a week, kind of at minimum. Otherwise, again, youre not going to have the chance to establish yourself and to take advantage of all of those touch points and the marketing rule of seven and the mirror exposure effect. And that leads me perfectly to the next kind of secret, which is that you want to go deep rather than broad. let me tell you what is probably my biggest pet peeve when it comes to marketing. And thats whenever I ask somebody, well, whos your target market? And they say everyone or people with money. And thats amazing. Thatd be great. But theres 8 billion people on the planet. And I promise you, you dont want all of them. Even if they all wanted to do business with you, some of them are terrible, terrible fits for your business. why dont we rein that in a little bit? And even if we were to say, separate men and women, well, now were down to 4 billion, or then we separate to this country. Now were down to 100 million. And then maybe this area. Now were down to 30 million. I mean, still, were going to want to carve that down to a significantly lower number. Someone that youre going to be able to connect with, someone that youre going to be able to connect with on a deeper level. the easiest way to do this is to take a look at yourself and your business. Now, I appreciate you are not your customer. You know, things that they dont know, you have experiences that they dont have. However, most people, when it comes to business, theyre solving a problem that they had at some point. Theyre solving something that they know about, that they care about, that they want to share and help other people. you probably understand a little bit about your situation and what theyre going through. And therefore, youre more likely to attract people similar to you. Its another kind of same reason that if youre a personal brand or a coach or consultant or someone that, you tend to attract people, give or take 10 years around your age. if youre 30, youll attract 20 to 40. If youre 40, youll attract 30 to 50, whatever it is. Theres this 20 year sliding scale, 10 years on each side that tends to work. That can balloon out a little bit here and there, but on average, youll find most of your people fall in that range. Again, its because you relate to them better. You know the words that they use. You grew up in the similar time. You have the same references, all of that stuff. But the point is you want to go deep here and you want to make better connections with fewer people than these superficial surface level connections with a ton of people. The big reason here is because when you go broad, when you go after everybody, youre forced to naturally water down your message. It becomes more vanilla. It becomes more bland. And it has to, because if you were being specific about someones unique pains and unique problems, well, it wouldnt be appealing or interesting to everybody else. therefore, you have to be more specific about what youre doing. And if youre not, then youre not going to be able to do that. You have to make it broad. And when youre broad, youre boring and everybody ignores you. And you sound 99 of the other businesses and marketers out there saying the same things. we offer higher quality and we offer better service and all of that stuff that everybodys heard a million times before. And theyre completely blind and deaf too. the best way to solve this is to move on to our next point here, which is that you need an ICA. ICA is Marketing Talk for Ideal Customer Avatar. Im not completely strict on this exact fictional representation of your ideal customer and youve got to give them a name and a hair color and theyve got to wear this kind of shoes and listen to this kind of music. I dont think thats necessary. Its helpful at times. What I think is more important is that you get clear around the commonalities, the common characteristics that your top customers, your top clients, your top audience members have in common. And we typically divide this into three different categories. The first of which being demographic. whats their age, their gender, their income, their occupation, their title, all of those stereotypical marketing things that we associate. And then we have the other thing thats important, which is that you have to number two, what are their geographic details? What city, state, province, country, where do they live? Number three, their psychographic details. This is all of the head stuff. And this is where the bulk of your ICA should be formed. what are their values, their attitudes, their interests, their beliefs, their organizations, their political affiliations, their lifestyles, things that make them them. After all, we often want to group people into these broad buckets men or women or this age or that age. But the reality is depending on what product or business youre using, you can have a wide range of that. And it may be more problem based. On the other hand, you may also have multiple different ICAs, ideal customer avatars. Thats cool too. Im all if youve got like, look, we work with women who are 20 to 25. And we also work with men who are 40 to 45. But those two different ICAs are going to have different pains and problems and fears and frustrations. Well talk about that in a second. you can serve them both, but you need to serve them both with different messages. You simply cant appeal to them, but you dont have to be like, oh, were going to serve them both. You have to be able to get rid of them both. And thats why you cant serve them both in a small way. But if you do have multiple ICAs, thats okay, because you can serve them both. you can serve them both. And you can serve them both, but you can also serve them both in a more specific way. And when youre doing that, youre not going to end up using the same generic, brand, broad, bland terminology, because youre going to turn the other one off by talking about things that are completely irrelevant to them. you have an ICA, but make sure that its specific and you can have multiple. And on that note, the way to dive into that is with the psychographic details of their values and attitudes, the money is, the value, the real results that youre going to get from your marketing come down to identifying their miracles and miseries. Now theres this great expression that I love that says customers dont buy when they understand, they buy when they feel understood. The way to make them feel understood is with this. their miracles, thats over here. Thats all the things that they want, their needs, their desires, their dreams, all of the things that they wish would happen, the desired end state of where theyre trying to get. And then of course, over here, youve got their miseries. These are their fears, their problems, their pains, their frustrations, all of the things that theyre trying to get away from, at least in regards to your business and to your offer. You need to identify what these are and ideally drill down into which the most important and the most painful ones are, and then what the most desirable end states are, because then youre going to be able to position your business as the bridge that takes them from miracle, to the most desirable end state that is possible. Ooh, there we go. Memo to self. I gotta buy some smaller tip markers. But thats it. This is your business there. Your businesss job, your offer, your product, your service, whatever it is that you sell, its only mission is to move them away from their current state that theyre in now, that they dont wanna be in, whatever that pain is and towards the desired end state. And the better that youre able to communicate that, which is essentially the job of marketing, its to communicate the value of what you have, thats the most valuable part of your life, of what you have, to them in regards to your offer, your product, your service, the better youre able to do that, the more likely you are to get somebody to take action and to buy from you and move them here. And thats, this is where the conversions happen. Its here. Its moving them away from miseries and towards miracles. And on that note, lets hit the next point here, which is a very cliched thing to say, but I want to break it down a little bit more. Theres this super cliched saying in marketing that says you want to sell the benefits, not the features or sell the sizzle, not the steak. The problem is, is that most cliches, theres that element of truth to it. That thats absolutely the fact here is when it comes to marketing and to representing what it is that youre selling and what youre trying to promote, its not about the features. Its about what those features are going to deliver through the benefits. Thats what theyre after. They dont care about features. They care about how those features are going to positively impact them. yes, we can make a cursory mention of the features. But what were after is that were going to highlight the features. Weve got to highlight them. Well talk about them and well talk about kind of the flip side of that in a second. But the real value is in the benefit. Now, one of my favorite examples, and it kind of stems from like, hey, sell me this pen. Well, it comes down to this pen doesnt have a pen cap, but were going to use that analogy anyway. Its sort of like, well, why does the pen have a pen cap or fictional pen cap? And the reason that this pen has a pen cap and the benefits it provides, thats what we want to highlight. the feature is a pen cap. The benefits is, well, it prevents you from getting ink all over yourself. And then of course we could elaborate on that. We could explain it a little further and on. A bit of a side note. Do you know why pen caps have those tiny little holes? I dont know if youve got a pen around, you can find one, but theyve got those little holes on the pen lid. Its if you swallow it, you dont choke to death. Random, hey? Anyway, the reason that benefits work significantly better than features is because benefits are emotionally driven. And emotion is far more powerful driver than logic. Doesnt mean we cant have logic. Doesnt mean we shouldnt use logic. We absolutely should. But emotion is the moneymaker. Thats what compels somebody to take action when they feel it deep down in their core. This is going to make my life better. This is going to help me achieve the goals that I want. This is going to increase my status. This is going to make me healthier or happier or wealthier or any of those intrinsic drivers that we have as humans. When were able to properly communicate that, thats when conversions happen. Thats when sales happen. Now heres the kicker. When youre first creating your marketing, whether its through an ad or a sales page or a social media post or an email, or anything that, we always want to highlight the benefits. And then of course, were going to talk about the features. But if for some reason people dont convert, we flip it. And then the next time we lead with features and we back up the benefits. And the reason that we do this is because we know that emotion is a significantly more powerful driver than logic. The logic still has a part. Not to mention, its not that some people are, or its not that some people are more emotional than logical. We all know those people that fall on one end of the spectrum or another. But its also that we, as people, we have days where were more emotional or more logical. And within those days, we have hours where were more emotional and more logical. And theres situations and circumstances that you cant always control for, which is why we want to cover our bases. We want to, of course, lead with emotion because its the most powerful driver, but we want to back it up with logic. The next time somebody interacts with us, if we tried emotion and it didnt work, well lead with logic and well back it up with emotion. And well kind of go back and forth. Well sprinkle in social proof. Well sprinkle in other forms of testimonials. Well sprinkle in, you know, a little bit of a sense of, you know, what theyre doing, what theyre doing, what theyre doing, what theyre doing, what theyre doing, what theyre doing, what theyre doing. And well use all of the tools in our toolbox as marketers to get somebody to take action, knowing full that we dont have control over where theyre at now in their current situation. And its funny, I didnt plan this, but this kind of leads us full circle back to that beginning statement of we need to highlight benefits. And if that doesnt work, we go for the logical element. And then we go back to benefits. All of this is going to take time. Its going to take energy, and its going to take investment in your marketing, which is why if youre at this stage now, where its not delivering the results that you want, you need to do more. Now, of course, Im not going to leave you hanging with that, which is why Im going to link up a video here. Thats going to show you a digital marketing strategy. Thats going to help. make sure to check it out now, and well see you in the next video. Now, the worst defense here is not having a marketing funnel or more accurately, not thinking about your marketing funnel and instead hoping and wishing."

28:25 Seven More Proven Marketing Strategies",Adam Erhart,2022-08-15T13:30:04Z,870956,21959,456,"Hey there, my friend, Adam here. And today I wanna walk you through 10 marketing tips and tactics and strategies, or rather give you a framework and a playbook that you can use to create marketing that works, that converts, thats profitable and helps you grow your business or any business youre working on. What this is going to help you do is essentially anytime that youre sitting down and youre thinking of ways to generate new customers or more leads or make more sales or launch a new campaign, its gonna give you a framework and a roadmap that you can follow from start all the way to finish to make sure that youre doing the things in the place for the people, rather than randomly guessing and hoping and praying that this might all magically work, which lets be honest, isnt much better than gambling. And that makes no sense at all, especially when there is a far more proven and strategic path that you can follow, one that has been replicated thousands, if not tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of times, both for myself and for my clients over the past 10 years and one that I know that if you follow and you work through, what Im about to share with you will have amazing and positive effects on your business and your marketing as well. with that said, lets dive in. Now, what youre looking at here is the original kind of brainchild behind all of this, a mess of words and of thoughts and ideas, all kind of tossed down on the paper. Of course, in typical Adam fashion being slightly a bit of a perfectionist, still working on it. Anyway, I cleaned it up a little bit. I made a better and cleaner diagram for you. And thats what I wanna walk you through here today, essentially starting in the middle and then working our way out. See, the problem is, when most people think about marketing, they think about business planning and strategy and things that, they view it as this linear path. Im gonna do this and then Im gonna do that and then its gonna be followed by this. When the reality is, its often a lot more of this kind of rollercoaster ride. Were gonna try this, were gonna get data and feedback, were gonna look at the analytics and the metrics, were gonna pivot and adjust accordingly, then were gonna go in this direction, then were gonna move this, then were gonna base those decisions off everything weve done and what worked and what didnt. And it continually evolves and you need to be able to evolve and adapt with it. All that said, there is a set of steps that you want to take. You dont wanna go out there and start posting on random social media accounts because then nothings going to work, youre gonna get frustrated, youre gonna get burned out and then you might give up on the whole thing altogether. And thats not good for you, its not good for the people that you hope to serve, its not good for anyone. the very first thing that you need to do anytime youre launching a new campaign, whether its an existing business or youre thinking of starting a new business, is you need to start in the center here with the offer. Now, I could, I could, make you struggle to understand my terrible handwriting was mocked up the time before, but Ive taken the effort to go and lets see if this works. I dont have perforated paper, but that worked better than I thought. here we are. Step number one is the offer. Now, theres a bit of a debate in the marketing community about when it comes to starting a business, when it comes to growing an existing business, do you focus on the offer first or the target market? In other words, do you want to make something and then find people to sell it to or do you wanna find people that you can help and then make something to solve their problems? No one seems to agree on this, Ive got a solution. If you have a brand new business, youve never sold anything to anyone, you have this idea in your mind, then typically youre better off thinking about the people that you seek to serve. Those are going to be people that you may have been one in the past or that you resonate with or that youre currently a member of the group. And the reason is, is because the better that youre able to understand your target market and their pains and problems and fears and frustrations and all the things were gonna talk about in a minute, the better youre going to be able to position your product or your service or your offer as the solution to their pains and problems. On the flip side, if you already have an existing business, youve been in business for any length of time, then the odds are good that you already have a number of different products or services or things that youre selling. the key here is to be specific and strategic and selective and make sure that youre choosing the offer with the best margins that is the most fun to deliver, that has the highest potential for scalability, thats easy to sort of market and clearly describe. to recap all of that, if youve got a new product or a new offer or something youre thinking of selling, do a little bit of market research, find the ideal segment of people that you can best serve and then make sure that theres a match there. If you already have an existing business, the odds are good that youve been selling something. find out what it is about that makes it unique and then find the best people that you can continue to serve by 8020ing your existing customers. Essentially taking a look at the top 20 of your customers. What are their commonalities, their traits? What do they, sort of have in common? Where do they live? All of the things that were going to talk about in a second when it comes to market. All right, that is our offer and thats going to form the core of everything that we do from this point on. Everything is going to be in alignment with this offer. Its going to be in service of this offer. Marketing is done and won one single offer at a time. You may have a number of different things you can do or want to do, but that doesnt mean you want to blast somebody with all of your different offers because its going to lead to overwhelm and to confusion and to this sort of paralysis by analysis, not knowing what to do or how to do it and confused customers dont buy. we start here. Okay, now that youve got the offer in mind, the next thing that you need to do is move on to this section here. Goals. Now heres the deal. When it comes to setting goals for your marketing, Im not a stickler for making sure that you, you set exact specific measurable goals. we want to increase our cost of acquisition or decrease our cost of acquisition by 3 or increase our leads by 22.8. But I do need you to have a North Star. A guiding sort of area light to work towards to make sure that youre going on the path rather than taking all of these completely irrelevant paths and ending up somewhere completely different thats not going to benefit you or your business or the people that you seek to serve. Good example here is that most business owners, most entrepreneurs, most marketers, sadly, they do marketing for the sake of marketing. They were told that, hey, we need to do some marketing. We need to make some stuff. they make some stuff and then they put it out there and unsurprisingly, it doesnt resonate because its stuff. Or they may have the wrong kind of goal, which is creating stuff for the sake of getting likes or comments or shares rather than building a community and increasing engagement with the kind of people that will lead to leads, that will lead to customers, that will lead to sales and revenue and actual business growth. Now, fortunately, when it comes to setting goals, the end goal is normally pretty simple. I mean, its going to be an increase in sales or an increase in revenue. And then all you have to do is start to work your way backwards to assign relevant metrics and KPIs known as key performance indicators, and then you can start to work your way backwards to assign relevant metrics and KPIs known as key performance indicators, to make sure that everything is in alignment. For example, if you have a thousand dollar product to sell and you know that you sell it by phone and you close one in two sales, well, now we figured out, well, were going to need two sales calls to make one sale. And then, okay, well, how many leads do we need to generate in order to have those two sales calls? And then how many clicks do we need to get those leads? And you can start to work your way back and at least it gives you sort of a direction to move towards. Okay, next up, we are going to draw the line and this one is all about target market. Target market, possibly the most important element in all of marketing. In fact, the word marketing, Weve got market baked into it. Thats how important this is. They are the core, the central component of your entire campaign, the entire structure. Everything you do is about your target market and whats in service to them. You see, the reality is, is that when it comes to marketing, the customer doesnt buy when they understand, they buy when they feel understood. And thats all about empathy. Its about awareness. Its about being able to put yourself in their shoes, to view things from their perspective. See, the reason that a lot of marketing doesnt work, doesnt connect with the target market is because its not relevant. Its not, it doesnt resonate with them. They dont understand how this would apply to them. And they tune it out. Good example here. If youve ever seen a commercial or a YouTube ad or a Facebook ad or any kind of ad or marketing material at all, and you thought, this is dumb. seriously, this makes no sense. I dont even know what theyre trying to sell. And if you do happen to figure out what theyre trying to sell, you think, what a dumb product. Who would ever buy that? And heres the thing. The product, the service, whatever it is being sold, might not be dumb. And the ad might be good, but youre not the target market. Now, sure, their targeting could be off. I dont know why youre seeing the ad thats not meant for you. Sometimes these things happen. But the point of the matter is, is that as long as youre specific and relevant to the kind of people, you will get them to take action. They will be inspired to want to get the solution to the problem that they have, provided that youve properly articulated it. That youve said the words in the way at the time. On the other hand, if you water down your message by trying to appeal to everybody out there, it becomes very bland and very boring and very generic. And then people automatically tune it out. And you know exactly what Im talking about. Talking about the things or the ads, the marketing that says we provide better service or faster delivery, or were superior, or whatever it is. First of all, these are not specific terms. Theyre very ambiguous. They could mean a lot of things to a lot of different people. Second of all, pretty much everybody can be a target market. Everybody can say them. Therefore, everybody does say them. Therefore, they mean nothing. Anyway, Im going to dive into more of the specifics on that in a second. But first, lets figure out your ideal target market, your ideal customer avatar, also sometimes known as an ICA. And to do that, we break it down into three different categories. The first of which is their demographic details. These are the stereotypical things you think of when you think of marketing and think of a target market. age, gender, income, occupation, titles, all of the things that are the generic customer avatar there. Then we have geographic details. What city, state, province, country, principality, municipality, neighborhood. Where do they live, basically? This is incredibly important because theres going to be cultural differences between not only different countries, but also different cities and sometimes even different neighborhoods in different cities. And then, of course, you have the mother of all, the psychographic details. What are their values, their attitudes, their lifestyles, their beliefs? What organizations are they a part of? Religious affiliations, political leanings, all of that stuff. All of the things that are not political and that people dont to talk about around the dinner table. Those are the things that you want to know. You want to get into their head and you want to know kind of what do they think about these things that were not supposed to talk about? Now, Im not suggesting you make all of your ads and all of your marketing directly call this stuff out, but it still is important to keep in the back of your mind when youre creating your marketing materials. What are these people going to like? What are they not going to like? What are they going to find offensive? And what is going to be polarizing, but in a good way thats going to draw them in and reject and repel everybody else that you dont want to deal with? After target market, well, of course, we have to drill down into those psychographic details even more. And to do that, were going to sort of break apart their miracles and miseries. Now, miracles and miseries are things that Ive coined that essentially make up the two different areas of your target market. Their miseries being their fears and problems and pains and frustrations and nightmares and all the things theyre trying to get away from. And their miracles being all of their wants and dreams and goals and desires and aspirations and all the things that theyre trying to move towards. Every person, every target market, every business has a way to appeal to someones miseries as as to their miracles. Theres going to be different industries that lean one way more than another. Theres going to be segments of the market that lean more one way or another. In other words, if you use messaging that helps someone move away from pain, sometimes thats stronger. On the other hand, you have more aspirational language helping someone achieve something and different markets are going to benefit more from that. A decent mix of both is usually the best path. We dont want to constantly be negative and say this is a horrible thing and you need to get it fixed and blah, blah. Otherwise, youre going to come off as a Debbie Downer. On the other hand, if all youre promising is rainbows and sunshine and unicorns and all the magical things in this world, well, theyre not going to have any reason to take action if you dont sort of back that up with a little bit of pain. In other words, a solution without a problem is completely meaningless. You need to put the solution in context to an actual problem that they have. Now, heres where things get confusing. Okay, the miracles and miseries essentially form a gap, a gap between where theyre at now with all of the bad stuff going on and where they want to be with all of the good stuff that theyd to have. And its your marketings job to help them bridge that gap away from miseries and towards miracles. And the better youre able to communicate that and show how if you do these things, if you acquire this product, if you use this service, if you take me up on this offer, youre going to be able to have it. Well, the better youre able to clearly communicate that, the better all of your marketing and all of your sales are going to be. All right, moving on. Next up, we have present and active. Now, this one is a bit of a pet peeve of mine. Ive got a few different marketing pet peeves, one of which is when I ask someone who their target market is and they say everyone or everyone in the world or people with money. And of course, as weve already covered, you cant be that broad, otherwise you end up with completely boring and bland and irrelevant messages. The other pet peeve I have is when people, business owners, entrepreneurs, marketers occasionally, hear about a new platform or a new social media channel or a new marketing opportunity and they dive in without doing all of the things that weve covered, all of the more important things that need to happen first, identifying the model, figuring out the target market, working out their miracles and miseries and all of those details. Instead, they dive headfirst into this new platform, make a bunch of stuff, nothing works, and then they swear off the platform for good. Well, unsurprisingly, the reason this doesnt work for most people most of the time is because this may be the completely wrong platform for you, for your business. Your people might not even be there. Your marketing in what I call the marketing wasteland, an area that is completely devoid of potential prospects and customers and leads for your business. Much better alternative to identify your ideal target market, figure out their demographic details age, gender, income, occupation, and then match it up with what social media platforms appeal to that demographic. Fortunately, this is not secret knowledge. All you have to do is head over to Google and type in social media demographics. Youll get a long list of different resources and itll start linking up men between the ages of this and this are on this platform and women between the ages of this and this are on this platform and this platform appeals to these kind of people. It changes all the time, but there are a few pretty safe bets. For example, if youre in the businesstobusiness community, youre selling to other businesses, LinkedIn is kind of a staple. If youre serving a demographic thats 35 or 40 and older, Facebook is still probably your best bet. If on the other hand, most of your customers are 35, 30, 25 perhaps, were looking at Instagram. TikTok, being the new kid on block, does skew younger, but all social media platforms, all platforms in general, it is aging up and doing relatively quickly. you can find people there 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s, and its continuing to age up. Twitter still skews slightly younger and a little more urban. Pinterest still primarily women. YouTube does tend to be kind of neutral territory for all people looking for all things. There is a kicker that you need to make video content, of course. More on that in a minute. And then of course, theres others that are popular in different countries, different Reddit forums, different WhatsApp groups, Snapchat, if your demographic is much younger. Lots of options, too many options. Thats why people get confused. See all these options. They think they need to be on all of them. The reality is youre much better off to choose the one or maybe two different platforms where your ideal target market is present and active and then go there ignoring everything else. lets draw our line and move on. now that weve figured all that out, the next thing that we need to do is weve got to figure out what kind of content are we going to make? And that leads us to content type. Now, what Im going to suggest here is that we need to establish a content type that youre going to start with. This may ultimately be or not be where you end up. Were going to talk about that more in a minute as well. Lots of cliffhangers and open loops in this video. keep watching. The point is, though, is that there is a lot to unpack and where were going to start is going to be different than where we end up because Im going to give you a couple of different options, but some are significantly superior to others. heres what youve got. Youve got textbased content, youve got audio content, and youve got video content. Arguably, you also have some kind of visual graphical content infographics and visual diagrams and things that, but typically theyre paired with one of the other kinds of content. You also have different lengths of content, short form and long form content. My suggestion is that pretty much every business out there needs one form of long form content, and then you can do whatever short form content you to feed into it. long form content for text is obviously a blog. Long form content for audio is a podcast. And long form content for video would be YouTube. Short form content, though, were talking about short tweets, were talking about short captions for Instagram, were talking about Facebook posts, were talking about LinkedIn posts, anything that for text. Audio is a little trickier. Were still kind of looking at mostly podcasts, possibly shorter ones, or taking clips and adding video elements to them. And then short form video is kind of the rage now. Short form, vertical video. Were looking at Instagram Reels, were looking at YouTube Shorts, were looking at TikTok. if you dont mind writing, you can start with text. If you dont mind speaking, you can do audio. And if you dont mind doing video or getting in front of a camera, finding someone thats willing to get in front of a camera, video is by far the best one. But again, well talk about that in a minute. well get our arrow there, and then lets do our next one, which is mandatory marketing. No exceptions. Every business needs to use this. Its email. Yeah, I know. Hoping for something a little sexier myself. But the fact is, is that email works. It works as now, if not better than it ever has before, because everybody uses email. I use email. You use email. Your customers use email. Your doctor, your accountant, your lawyer, everybody. Everybody that you know has an email address. Not everybody has a social media account. Not everybody accepts SMS or text message marketing or even appreciates it. Direct mail is still phenomenally effective, but its hard to find curated lists, especially for costeffective prices. And its a slightly more advanced and complicated marketing strategy that I wouldnt suggest starting out with. But everybody has email. Bit of a fun fact here, but when Im working with a brand new business, Im doing any kind of consulting or teaching, one of the very first things I do, if not the first thing I do, is take a look at their overall email marketing strategy. If they dont have a good one, well install one. If they have one thats working okay, well upgrade it. And I kid you not, every single time were able to make substantial and significant increases in profitability, in customer retention, in the number of sales made. Its just, its as close to a magic bullet as we have. So, where do you even get started? Well, the very first thing you need is some kind of a lead magnet, also known as a bribe or a freebie or a content upgrade. Essentially, something that you can give away in exchange for a customers email address that theyre in touch. for instance, if youre not the first one to join the list, whats the easiest thing you could do? If you are, you could go, take your email address card, manage more, or maybe even get your email for a timer. a couple of gre Bal detto. But I dont think no one can strongly recommend having this kind of codebook tool difference in any kind of booking due to traffic, and also start thinking about what services you further should approving or вещ. If you could figure out, a branch there, and you have broad options, maybe you can reach out to them there. From there, you need to decide on your email frequency, how often youre going to be emailing your list, whether its once a week or three times a week. Some people email daily. Ive done it in the past. Ive kind of found a sweet spot around three to four times a week. Once a week is your bare minimum. Once every two weeks is unacceptable. Once a month, and I dont even know why you have an email list. I mean, seriously, lets run the math for a second. If an email open rate is say 30 for your list and youre emailing once a month, well, it could be months before anybody sees you. And then when they finally do get your email, theyve forgotten who you are. theyre likely to unsubscribe or be worse, market as spam and delete the whole thing. Also depending on which statistic or study you read, marketing via email has been reported to provide somewhere between a 3,800 and 4,400 ROI or return on investment. I dont know if my numbers are around there, but they wouldnt be too far off. Its that good. Long story short, email. You got to do it. Okay. Moving on to the next one. Essentially, once youve got some of these pieces in place, its time to start looking at how youre going to start putting things together. And that comes in the form of a marketing funnel, also known as a sales funnel, also known as a customer journey, or a funnel. Aptly named because it kind of looks a funnel with a whole bunch of people coming in at the top and then kind of getting sorted out as they go through the bottom with fewer customers coming out the bottom. This is a reminder that most wont. I first heard this from Frank Kern who said most wont. In other words, most people wont click. Most people wont subscribe. Most people wont buy. And you need to factor that into your marketing and plan accordingly. But this is fine. This is because most wont, but enough will, provided you do things right. Now what a marketing funnel is about is mapping out the customer journey, taking someone who has no idea who you are and walking them through all of the steps in order to become a lifelong and loyal customer, a brand ambassador, someone that loves you, loves what you do, wants to tell everyone about how great you are. And youre pretty great. Now the opposite of having a marketing funnel is having nothing. I dont know what the opposite of a funnel would be. a plate. You pour stuff on it. It splashes everywhere. Sadly, most people have marketing plates. In other words, they take all of the traffic and all of the leads and they dump them somewhere, typically on their homepage. Meaning that someone shows up at your websites homepage. They have no idea what theyre doing. They dont know where to go. They might click the contact button, but theres a weird form and they dont know if they want to do that yet because they met you. Its kind of pushy. Lets slow down here. they kind of skirt around a little bit and then they bounce, which is marketer term for leave and never come back. Again, depending on what statistic you use. The vast majority of visitors to a website that click the back button never return somewhere around the range of 98 to 99. Where are they going? You might ask. And let me tell you, theyre going to your competitors that have a funnel. Something that says, Hey, youre new here. Lets start here. Let me give you this thing. Let me nurture you and provide you some value. Let me follow up, see if you have any questions and let me continue offering you the next step in the process in order to becoming a customer. Now the best advice that I can offer in a short period of time when it comes to mapping out your marketing funnel is to start at the end. Start with your goals and then reverse engineer the process. in other words, for someone to make a sale, well, what needs to happen before that? Maybe its visit a sales page. Okay. Well, what needs to happen before they visit a sales page? Its like, okay, they need to click a link. Okay. Well, what needs to happen for them to click a link? Are they getting it through content or through email? And then if they got on your email, how are they getting on your email? And essentially you can work your way backwards through the process. And then once its all mapped out, thats where things get exciting. Yeah. Kind of nerdy about this stuff. Because once its mapped out. Yeah. You can start looking for gaps for leaks in your funnel. You can start finding areas where youre losing people through some random mistake or messaging. This doesnt quite line up. For example, if everybodys clicking over to your sales page, but nobodys opting in or nobodys buying. Well, now we know we have a conversion issue on the sales page. On the other hand, if people are joining your email list, but then never opening any of your emails. Well, now we know we have an issue with congruence between what was promised and whats being delivered, or perhaps were collecting bad emails. Or if we map it all the way out. Then we get to the sales call and we realize that were only closing one in four or one in five when we should be closing one in three or one in two. now we know we can start looking at that and we can look at all of the steps up to it. And was there a congruence issue again? Were there pricing expectations? Were there other objections and sales issues that we could have overcome in our marketing prior? Whats cool about this is that we make a small tweak over here and we increase conversions by 2 and we increase that one by 3 and that one by 1. Well, its not were adding these things up. one after another, they compound. an increase by 3 here could lead to 10 or 20 or 30 more sales, which could then lead to thousands or tens of thousands or even millions more dollars in revenue at the end. Speaking of revenue, next step here after our funnel is CLV, which stands for customer lifetime value. Sometimes referred to as LTV for lifetime value or LCV for lifetime customer value, whatever it is. Its pretty much all the same thing. Which is what is the value of a customer to your business over their lifetime? Period. Now, some people look at this in revenue. Some people look at it in profit. I typically to look at it in profit, but it depends on the formula that were looking at. The point is, if youve never done this before, this is an incredibly powerful exercise to run through to figure out how valuable someone is to your business. And Im willing to bet regardless of what business or market or industry youre in, its significantly higher than you thought, which means that you now have permission to do significantly more marketing. And invest in significantly more content because you know how profitable and how valuable new customers and new clients and new sales are for your business. thats step one, figure out what is your CLV. After that, you need to find ways to encourage and increase retention. The number of clients and customers that youre going to keep, the length of time that youre going to keep them, and then finding other ways to increase that customer lifetime value. Either by selling them more things, by selling them more things more often, by increasing the price. By providing upsets. By providing upsells and downsells and crosssells. Essentially other ways and other opportunities to solve problems that they have. And thats an important point to make here. What were doing with our marketing and with our offers is were solving problems that they have. And when we solve a big enough problem, were rewarded in direct proportion to the value of the problem we solve. This is why some people make a whole lot of money. Its because they solve big problems. Some people struggle to make any money at all because theyre not solving enough problems for enough people or theyre not solving big enough problems for enough people. that is CLV. And what you may notice is that is kind of the final ring of our concentric expanding circles. Moving all the way out. But we still have one left. And the reason that I almost didnt want to give it a ring of its own but rather have it sort of circle the whole thing is because, especially today, especially now and moving into the future, its important that it almost needs to overlap and encompass everything else that were doing. This is going to support all of the marketing of your offer. Okay. Again, I wanna give it a try. No need to get sigue. No need to get sick. No need to get sick. Its going to help move you towards your goals faster than you ever thought. Its appealing to every target market. More people consume this kind of content than anything else. It checks the box for being able to clearly articulate miracles and miseries. It works with almost every single platform, which means we can put it in front of people and where theyre present and active online. Its the best content type. We can embed it in email. It works as part of the funnel, on and forth. Probably no surprise here that the final piece of the puzzle is video. Essentially, the big question that you want to ask yourself here is how can you supercharge everything youre doing with a video marketing strategy? Now, clearly, for long form video, YouTube is the best place to do it. That said, I appreciate that if youve never done video marketing before, if youre getting started, youre not comfortable in front of a camera, thats a pretty big ask. we can put that on the back burner for now. And there are a lot smaller and somewhat still very effective steps that you can take leading up to this inevitable conclusion. Number one, start with stories. Grab your phone. Start with stories. Grab your "

There are too many variables to ever say “do x and you’ll get y result.” To get the best results, you need to always be experimenting. Let's have a look at one such experimental incidents which turned into an epic in the field of marketing.",SHOT BY SHOT,2020-05-11T17:20:11Z,722178,0,136,"The products are made in the factory, but brands are created in the mind. Even though we consider ourselves logical and modern human beings, the majority of our decisions are made by the ancient instinctive subconscious part of our brains, sometimes referred to as our reptilian brain. Lets have an insight into one such example in the field of marketing. In the 1970s, Japans economy was booming, and Nestle was looking for the way to transform that into dollars. Obviously, the option they chose was coffee. But not fast. It was no secret that Japanese consumers loved tea greatly. Nestle tested the market cautiously before jumping in. They ran several focus groups, asking consumers from every age group what they thought of Nestle coffee. Surprisingly, everyone loved it. All focus group came back incredibly positive. Japanese consumers liked the taste of coffee. Nestle executives got excited and they shifted into high gear, preparing a rollout plan to have coffee on every shelf in Japan. Huge sums were spent on marketing and distribution, and coffee hit the market with a huge amount of demand. And then It wasnt as expected. Nestle coffee wasnt selling in Japan. Is there anything more depressing than an empty coffee shop? It made no sense. Every study showed that Nestle coffee would be the next big thing, but Japanese consumers stuck to tea. Japanese consumers liked the taste of coffee but simply chose not to buy it. Faced with this challenging situation, Nestle decided to bring in the superstar of marketing, Claudia. The companys CEO, Claudia, was a famous coffee brand. She was known for her unique taste in coffee. She was known for her unique taste in coffee. She was known for her unique taste in coffee. She was known for her unique taste in coffee. She was known for her unique taste in coffee. She was known for her unique taste in coffee. She was known for her unique taste in coffee. She was known for her unique taste in coffee. Claudia who was known for her unique taste in coffee. Claudia was known a long time for coffeesimilar and there were many name recommendations regarding this Mazda name and theàpORA audiences were thinking of her as many as on the list in theéricas stocks. An example of Clotters work was with Jeeps latest models which hadnt been selling and the company couldnt understand why. Clotter came back with the oddest of suggestions. Go back to using round headlights. Clotter realized that for American consumers, a Jeep meant freedom. It was the symbol of Wild West, of running free and equivalent to horse. For Americans, the Jeep was the modern horse. When Jeep had changed their headlight shape from round to square, they had lost that connection because the headlights no longer looked a horses eyes. Jeep changed it back and the sales went up unbelievably. Now back to Nestle in Japan. When Clotter arrived, he was quick to understand that Japanese consumers had no connection to coffee, no early childhood association. Japanese kids grew up watching their parents drink tea. They lived with the smell of tea in the air and ate teaflavored snacks. Was it any surprise that, as adults, they chose tea over coffee? So, what did Clotter recommend? Yes. The coffee candies. Suddenly, hordes of Japanese kids began to discover the taste of coffee through dozens of different candy types. From there, they eventually moved on to cold sugary coffeeflavored drinks. And then to Lattes. And then. Before they knew it, big steamy mugs of Nescafe coffee. Not bad for a market that wouldnt buy coffee 40 years ago.

And in this video, were going to explore the best marketing strategy for promoting a new business or a new product. Essentially, were going to be looking at a simple method that you can use to choose and execute on the best marketing opportunities for your specific business. Now, this is a follow up to a previous video that I published on 33 ways to get more customers. You can find a link to that video in the description box below. And of course, if youre interested in learning more about how to build and grow your business, then I recommend that you subscribe to the channel and turn on notifications you dont miss out on future videos. But lets get into it. The number one reason why new businesses fail is that they dont attract enough customers. And the reality is a lot of businesses make it through the other stages, coming up with a brand name, coming up with a logo, even building out a basic product or service. But unfortunately, many of them fail when it comes to attracting prospects and converting those prospects into customers. that is the entire focus of this video. Were going to be going through a simple four step framework called the Bullseye Framework. This is from Traction by Gabriel Weinberg and Justin Mares, a great book for startups that are looking to attract customers to their business. And this is a simple, I say, a four step process that you can use to attract customers. The very first step is to brainstorm marketing ideas. what you want to do here is you want to go through all the different ways that you could possibly attract customers to your business, and you want to come up with realistic scenarios for how you might execute on those opportunities. Now, I mentioned earlier that I recently published a video covering 33 ways to get more customers. You can go through that video. Thats 33 different marketing channels that are covered in that video. And the idea here, even though were not going to be pursuing all 33 channels at once, wed be spreading ourselves way too thin. The idea here is to come up with realistic scenarios for each and every one of them, as an exploratory process. So, for example, if you go down the list and you see content, marketing, you want to come up with a realistic scenario for how you might promote your business using content marketing. What kind of articles could you create? What kind of videos would you create a podcast? You want to explore exactly how you might pursue that opportunity if you absolutely had to. And then you want to do the same as you go down the list with search advertising, social advertising, hosting live events. You might consider, you know, would you host a local meetup, a small meetup group with enthusiastic customers? Or would you try to put on a big fancy event and invite other, other speakers, whatever the marketing channel might be? The idea here is to simply explore the possibilities, to reasonably brainstorm what you could do if you absolutely had to pursue the various different marketing opportunities that are out there. And the reason why this is important is because oftentimes businesses get stuck in a rut where they only pursue marketing channels that all of their rivals are pursuing. if you see another potential competitor using search advertising, you might be tempted to say, okay, search advertising is the way that you market this kind of business. And that limits your options. And unfortunately, when you follow that kind of strategy, youre playing into your competitors strengths and youre pursuing a channel that is already going to be competitive, by its very definition, the most popular channels may not necessarily be the best opportunities. Sometimes they are still, sometimes they arent. thats the entire point of this first step is to explore what you might do if you had to pursue. And thats what were going to do today. Were going to go through a few different channels in order to flesh them out and see what might be possible. Step number two is to select promising channels. this is a very important step where we start to narrow the field. Instead of pursuing all 33 channels, we want to narrow it down to about three to five of the most promising opportunities. And when I say promising, because youre a startup, your number one priority should be speed. you want to find channels that are likely to create results for you quickly. you want to find channels that are likely to offer a lot of customers, youre talking about both volume of customers and speed at which you can attract them. And of course, another consideration would be your ability to attract them profitably. because a channel can deliver a lot of customers and can do quickly, you know, it might not be cost effective to pursue it. thats the kind of thing you want to be thinking about as you narrow down the field to three to five of the most promising channels or the most promising opportunities based on your initial brainstorming. Now its time to move on to step three. And step three is something that I think a lot of businesses skip over naturally when they try to pursue marketing opportunities. And step three is to perform inexpensive tests. This is critical because even if an opportunity seems promising, and as you go through how you might pursue it, it seems attractive and it might be exciting. The fact is not all marketing channels are equal. And sometimes you might be surprised to find out that one channel isnt that effective. And if you dont compare it to one channel, and you dont compare its results with another channel, then youre never able to make that differentiation and to realize, hey, this might be a half decent opportunity, but over here is a much, much better opportunity that we should be focusing all of our time and attention on. this step is all about simply performing inexpensive, simple tests to validate the potential of each of your promising opportunities. Now, one mistake a lot of businesses make when it comes to testing marketing opportunities this is they try to overly optimize in the process. for example, if you were gonna place ads on Google AdWords, you might go on there and say, okay, I have 40 margin on my product. I cant afford to spend more than 40 per conversion here. And if Im spending more than that, then this channel isnt very promising. And that thought process leads them to aim for targets and to set their ad spend in a way that is unlikely to provide great results. And thats what Im trying to do here. And the reason why this is bad is because the only goal of this step here is to validate two things. One, that there are enough customers in this channel that its worth pursuing. And two, that you have a vague sense that if you took the time to optimize your efforts and to improve your ad copy and to improve your landing page and your entire marketing funnel as it relates to that channel, then over time, you almost certainly will be profitable. Thats what youre trying to figure out. Youre not trying to optimize because if you do that too early, youre ruling out a channel before you even give it a chance to breathe. what you want to do here is simply perform inexpensive tests to validate there are customers there and that its worth your time and energy to pursue things further. And then afterwards, later in the future, you can worry about doing all that optimization. In some cases, it takes months, if not years, to perfect your entire approach to that channel. And thats perfectly okay. You can do that in the future and its not going to affect your longterm potential with that channel. But the idea behind this is that youre going to have to do a lot of work. And the reason behind this step is simply to validate that its worth your time to explore things further. And then we move on to step number four, which is to look at all these tests that we performed and to select one promising channel, to select the single thing that were going to focus on when it comes to building momentum with the business. And this is incredibly important when it comes to a brand new startup because you cant afford to be spreading yourself too thin. And the reality is that when it comes to a lot of marketing channels, theres a bit of a winner take all dynamic that happens with marketing channels. Google search is a great example of this. The person that is able to best optimize and best outperform their rivals when it comes to advertising for a specific keyword or a specific family of keyword phrases, they tend to far outperform whoever is second in that area. Whoever is second best at utilizing that marketing channel. it pays to become an absolute master at least one channel when youre growing a business. In fact, thats pretty common wisdom within the marketing community that you really, if you want to have a successful business, there should be at least one channel out there that the entrepreneur or founder, or at least one of the cofounders of the business is incredibly familiar with and is very proficient at using. And that gives the business a lot of strength. And the idea here is simple, You want to focus on one channel. You want to become great at that one channel and you want to absolutely focus your efforts on capitalizing on all of the potential of that channel until of course you hit diminishing returns. And thats the point at which spending more money on the channel doesnt give you more results. You might find a point, lets say Google AdWords, you might find spending more than 50,000 in a given period simply does not increase results. And at that point, its time to revisit this process, explore other channels and figure out what second or third channel you can tag on to expand your business. But thats the process here. Its straightforward. Its simple. It might almost seem too simple, but thats okay. And you can do that. And its a very powerful way to, I say, select and test and ultimately find the one channel that is most promising for your business. Anyway, thats it for this video.
