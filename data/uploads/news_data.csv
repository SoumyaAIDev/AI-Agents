Coinbase becomes Ethereum&#039;s largest node operator with 11% stake,https://cointelegraph.com/news/coinbase-largest-ethereum-node-operator-11-percent-staked-eth?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound," Coinbase is Ethereum’s largest node operator, holding 11.42% of staked ETH with validators achieving 99.75% uptime, outperforming network averages.  A Coinbase report revealed that the crypto exchange is the largest node operator on the Ethereum network, controlling 11.42% of the total staked Ether. In a performance report, Coinbase said it had 3.84 million Ether (ETH), worth about $6.8 billion, staked to its validators. The exchange said that, as of March 3, it has 11.42% of the total staked ETH.  Anthony Sassano, host of The Daily Gwei, said that Coinbase's stake makes the exchange the “single largest node operator” in the network.  Sassano added that while the staking platform Lido is bigger as a collective, each node operator has a much smaller percentage share.  Source: Anthony Sassano Related: 83% of institutions plan to up crypto allocations in 2025: Coinbase Coinbase also shared that it exceeded its target for validator uptime, which indicates the percentage of time when validators are operational. It also had a similar figure for its participation rate, a metric that indicates how well validators perform their consensus duties. Coinbase also reported that its validators had an average uptime of 99.75%. Coinbase said they outperformed their target of 99% uptime without compromising security standards.  The exchange attributed the performance to an upgrade implemented in 2024, which allowed the exchange to keep validators running while performing beacon node maintenance.  Meanwhile, Coinbase validators’ participation rate is also at 99.75%. This exceeds the network average of 99.52%. In addition, the Coinbase average for signing and submitting blocks produced by their MEV relays is 99.76%, higher than the network average of 99.38%.  While Coinbase operates a centralized exchange platform, the company said it distributes its validators across several regions to “help maintain a truly distributed and decentralized Ethereum blockchain.” The exchange said its validators operate in Japan, Singapore, Ireland, Germany and Hong Kong.  Coinbase validator average performance versus Ethereum network averages.

Why is Bitcoin price up today?,https://cointelegraph.com/news/why-is-bitcoin-price-up-today?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound," Bitcoin jumped as markets reacted to the Fed’s dovish signals and rising BTC accumulation by long-term holders.  Bitcoin (BTC) price has jumped by 4% in the last 24 hours to reach over $86,000 on March 20. At its intraday high, the cryptocurrency was trading for $87,470, signaling modest profit-taking among traders. BTC/USD four-hour price chart.

Rising BTC supply among long-term holders’ addresses. Bitcoin rose as the Federal Reserve signaled it still expects to cut interest rates twice later this year, easing investor concerns over prolonged monetary tightening. Key takeaways from the Federal Open Market Committee’s meeting on March 19: The Fed kept its benchmark rate on hold while acknowledging that tariff-driven inflation pressures may be “transitory.” Chair Jerome Powell’s measured tone on recession risk, stating it was ""not high,"" reassured risk-on investors. The Fed trimmed its growth forecast, fueling a bond rally and reinforcing expectations of lower borrowing costs in the future. US 2-year and 10-year Treasury note yields daily chart.

A decisive pullback may lead the pair initially toward the 50-4H EMA at around $83,900.

Bitcoin price tags 2-week highs as markets bet big on Trump crypto news,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-2-week-highs-markets-bet-big-trump-crypto-news?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound," Bitcoin sees some much-needed relief thanks to a combination of Fed policy confirmation and rumors of a ""significant update"" to US crypto plans.  Bitcoin (BTC) spiked to two-week highs on March 20 amid rumors that the US government was preparing a “major update” to its crypto policy. BTC/USD 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD reaching nearly $87,500 on Bitstamp. Currently consolidating near $86,000, Bitcoin benefitted from a fairly cool Federal Reserve meeting the day prior in which officials opted to hold interest rates at current levels. Policymakers confirmed that they envisage two cuts by the end of 2025, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell describing inflation as having “eased significantly.” “We do not need to be in a hurry to adjust our policy stance, and we are well positioned to wait for greater clarity,” he said in an opening statement before a press conference that followed the rates decision. A “wait-and-see” approach was enough to relieve troubled risk assets, with Bitcoin joining US stocks in surging and finishing the day higher. The S&P 500 ended up by around 1% for the March 20 session, adding $500 billion in market cap. Reacting, Arthur Hayes, former CEO of crypto exchange BitMEX, suggested that the Fed had delivered a key signal for traders to add risk. “JAYPOW delivered, QT basically over Apr 1.

$77K likely the Bitcoin bottom as QT is ‘effectively dead’ — Analysts,https://cointelegraph.com/news/arthur-hayes-calls-bitcoin-price-77k-bottom-analysts-qt-dead?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound," The Fed’s quantitative tightening is “basically over,” which has crypto analysts feeling slightly more bullish about its implications for the crypto market.  Bitcoin is unlikely to revisit the $77,000 price level anytime soon after the Fed signaled a slowdown in quantitative tightening (QT), says BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes. On March 10, Bitcoin (BTC) dipped near the $77,000 level for the first time since November, according to CoinMarketCap data. “Was BTC $77k the bottom, prob,” Hayes said in a March 20 X post after declaring that QT is “basically over” following the Fed’s March 19 announcement that starting in April, it will slow its securities sell-off by reducing the monthly Treasury cap from $25 billion to $5 billion.  Bitcoin is up 3.53% over the past seven days. Source: CoinMarketCap This could ease liquidity pressures and support risk assets like Bitcoin, as QT involves central banks selling assets to reduce the money supply and possibly raise interest rates.  “The next thing we need to get bulled up for realz is either SLR exemption and or a restart of QE,” Hayes added. The Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR) exemption was a temporary rule during the COVID-19 pandemic that allowed banks to exclude US Treasury securities from their SLR calculations. Meanwhile, quantitative easing (QE) is a monetary policy that aims to stimulate the economy and encourage more spending. Echoing a similar sentiment to Hayes, Real Vision chief crypto analyst Jamie Coutts said in a March 19 X post that “QT is effectively dead.” Coutts explained that “treasury volatility” has calmed down following the US dollar's drop earlier this month, a positive signal for boosting liquidity. Other optimists included Axie Infinity co-founder Jeff “JiHo” Zirlin, who said the Fed slowdown is “great for both crypto and equity markets.” “The Fed has significant leeway to loosen up, providing more support for businesses + markets,” Zirlin said, while Bitcoin venture capitalist Mark Moss said that with QT ending, “the dam is going to break.” Related: Bitcoin risks new 'death cross’ as BTC price tackles $84K resistance Meanwhile, crypto market sentiment has spiked following the Fed’s comments.  The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, which tracks overall sentiment, has moved into “Neutral” territory at 49 after lingering in the “Fear” area since Feb. 26. Despite Bitcoin being down nearly 22% from its January $109,000 all-time highs, Infinex founder Kain Warwick told Cointelegraph that it is a “normal mid-bull correction.” “I would need to see a much larger breakdown to flip bearish,” Warwick said. “My baseline thesis is the four-year cycle holds once again, which means we keep grinding up through the rest of the year.” Magazine: Classic Sega, Atari and Nintendo games get crypto makeovers: Web3 Gamer This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

US recession would be a big catalyst for Bitcoin: BlackRock,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-benefit-us-recession-blackrock-crypto-head?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound," Bitcoin would be a big winner from a potential US recession as it’s built to thrive in a high fiscal spending, low interest rate environment, says a BlackRock executive.  BlackRock’s head of digital assets, Robbie Mitchnick, says that Bitcoin will most likely thrive in a recessionary macro environment, contrary to what some analysts may think.  “I don’t know if we’ll have a recession or not, but a recession would be a big catalyst for Bitcoin,” Mitchnick said in a March 19 interview with Yahoo Finance.Mitchnick said Bitcoin (BTC) is catalyzed by increased fiscal spending, deficit accumulation, lower interest rates and monetary stimulus — all of which tend to happen in recessions. “And it’s catalyzed to some extent over fears of general social disorder,” Mitchnick pointed out. “And that too, unfortunately, is something that can happen in a recession.” 🚨 LATEST: BlackRock Global Head of Digital Assets Robbie Mitchnick says, “If you look at Bitcoin fundamentally on a long-term basis, it really seems like an asset that should be uncorrelated or even inversely correlated against certain risk factors that exist.” pic.twitter.com/bC0zKqF3xB The BlackRock executive said the market is “not particularly well calibrated” to Bitcoin, and many still view it as a risk-on asset. Risk-on assets, such as stocks, commodities and high-yield bonds, tend to suffer during times of economic crises, but Mitchnick said in September that he believed the asset was mislabeled.  Mitchnick said BlackRock has been helping some of its clients see through some of these conflicting narratives. He added that some of BlackRock’s more “sophisticated long-term Bitcoin accumulator” clients see the market correction as a buying opportunity and aren’t bothered by the current economic headwinds. Meanwhile, researchers from cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase were less bullish, saying crypto’s positive outlook for the first quarter had “clearly been misplaced” by recession fears and the recent tariffs imposed. “Fears of a dramatic US economic slowdown or even recession have caused sentiment to turn sharply,” Coinbase Institutional said in its monthly outlook report on March 17. Related: Crypto market’s biggest risks in 2025: US recession, circular crypto economy BlackRock has played a key role in the institutional and wealth advisory adoption of Bitcoin through its iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF — which holds the most net assets of any Bitcoin investment product at $48.7 billion.

Bitcoin long-term holder behavior shift signals &#039;unique market dynamic&#039; — Research,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-unique-market-dynamic-long-term-holders?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound," Bitcoin long-term holders continued to hold profits despite BTC prices dropping to a four-month low, indicating a strong belief that the bull market rally would eventually resume.  Bitcoin’s corrective phase set a four-month low at $76,600 on March 11. Despite this decline, long-term holders have continued to hold large amounts of BTC, suggesting a “unique market dynamic moving forward,” new research says.  “Long-Term Holder activity remains largely subdued, with a notable decline in their sell-side pressure,” Glassnode said in a March 18 markets report. Bitcoin’s recovery comes as selling pressure among Long-Term Holders (LTHs) — wallets that have held Bitcoin for at least 155 days — begins to wane.  The Binary Spending Indicator, a metric used to determine when LTHs are spending a significant proportion of their holdings in a sustained manner, shows a slowdown (see chart below) while the LTH supply is also beginning to rebound after several months of decline. “This suggests that there is a greater willingness to hold than to spend coins among this cohort,” Glassnode noted, adding: Bitcoin: LTH spending binary indicator. Source: Glassnode Bull market tops are often marked by intense sell-side pressure and strong profit-taking among LTHs, which signals a complete shift to bearish behavior.  However, despite Bitcoin's drawdown in recent weeks, this investor cohort continues to hold a large portion of their profits, especially for this later stage of the cycle, Glassnode said.  This could suggest that long-term holders may still be expecting more BTC price upside later in the year. Bitcoin: Cumulative LTH realized profit.

BTC rose in early Asian hours on Thursday following the Wednesday Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, where the Fed kept rates intact but lowered growth outlooks until 2027. Ether (ETH) remained muted after a sudden 7% jump late Wednesday, ending the day up 3.%. Solana’s SOL, dogecoin (DOGE), and BNB Chain’s BNB showed gains under 6%, while Uniswap’s UNI surged 8% as token holders passed a $165 million foundation funding proposal. XRP jumped as high as 12% before paring gains, as closely-related Ripple Labs ended its long-standing battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), stating Wednesday that the case had “come to an end.” The asset got a further boost in the U.S. as Bitnomial said it would launch futures tied to the token for local investors from Thursday in a first for the region. 🚀 XRP futures are here! 🚀Bitnomial is launching the first-ever CFTC-regulated $XRP futures in the U.S. — physically settled for real market impact.

Separately, his national economic adviser, Kevin Hassett, said he anticipated a 2.5% growth rate against the Fed’s 1.7% expectation. “The Fed would be MUCH better off CUTTING RATES as U.S.Tariffs start to transition (ease!) their way into the economy,” Trump said in a Truth Social post. “Do the right thing.

"Bitcoin Traders Seek Topside Option Plays After Powell's Transitory Inflation Remark, Ether Still Lags in Sentiment",https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/03/20/bitcoin-traders-seek-topside-option-plays-after-powell-s-transitory-inflation-remark-ether-still-lags-in-sentiment,"Bitcoin (BTC) punters are looking at topside options bets in a bullish shift in price expectations after the Federal Reserve's (Fed) meeting, but ether (ETH) continues to lag sentiment.  As of writing, BTC's short-term and long-term risk reversals, which show the implied volatility premium (demand) for bullish bets or calls versus puts, were positive, implying investor interest in chasing price gains in the leading cryptocurrency, per data source Amberdata. It marks a shift from the bearish sentiment that prevailed weeks before the Fed meeting when short and near-dated puts were pricier than calls, reflecting downside fears. ""Frontend skew flipped calls. Flows featured 21 Mar outright calls and calendars bought, while 28 Mar puts were sold,"" institution-focused over-the-counter tech platform Paradigm noted in the Telegram chat. Institutions and large traders execute block trades via OTC platforms like Paradigm, which are then listed on Deribit. Options are derivative contracts that give the purchaser the right but not the obligation to purchase or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price at a later date. A call option gives the right to buy, and a put option gives the right to sell. The bullish shift in the short and near-dated options happened as the Federal Reserve (Fed) retained the forecast for two rate cuts this year despite making the expected stagflationary adjustment in economic forecasts. The bank said it will slow the pace of balance sheet run off from April.  More importantly, Chairman Jerome Powell downplayed fears about the inflationary impact of Trump's tariffs, calling it transitory. Additionally, the end of the prolonged legal tussle between the SEC and Ripple, which uses XRP for cross border transactions, likely aided the sentiment. XRP, with the market cap of $142.21 billion, is the world's fourth largest cryptocurrency.  These positive developments, however, are yet to translate into a positive flip in the short and near-dated ether options.  At press time, ether risk reversals showed a bias for puts out to the May expiry, retaining the pre-Fed cautious sentiment despite the looming Ethereum Pectra upgrade. The technological update will introduce smart accounts to ethereum, blob scaling and validator UX enhancements and seen as a game changer by many. Ethereum developers launched a new test network, Hoodi, this week to carry out the impending upgrade, expected to take effect on March 26.

"Bitcoin Reclaims $85K Following Fed and Stocks Rose, but One Analyst Suggests Caution",https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/03/19/bitcoin-reclaims-usd85k-following-fed-and-stocks-rose-but-one-analyst-suggests-caution,"Crypto markets are experiencing a modest move to the upside following today’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, in which the U.S. central bank left interest rates steady at 4.25%-4.50% Bitcoin (BTC) has risen 4.5% in the last 24 hours and is now trading for $85,500, its highest point since March 9. The CoinDesk 20 — an index of the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization except for stablecoins, memecoins and exchange coins — is up 6%. Ether (ETH) and solana (SOL) have both surged by 7%, while Ripple’s XRP token has risen 10% off the back of CEO Brad Garlinghouse’s announcement that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is planning to drop its case against the company. Crypto stocks are also doing relatively well, especially bitcoin mining companies like Bitdeer (BTDR) and Core Scientific (CORZ), which are up 10% and 8% on the day, respectively. Bitdeer is likely buoyed from the technological progress it recently made in its ASIC manufacturing process, as well as from the news that stablecoin giant Tether was increasing its stake in the company to 21%. Core Scientific, meanwhile, is potentially reaping the benefits of AI firm CoreWeave (Core Scientific’s main customer) filing for an initial public offering earlier in the month. Even so, both companies are down more than 61% and 53% since January and November respectively. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said that tariff-related inflation was likely to be transitory and that recession risks remained low. And despite the market reacting positively to the meeting — Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones all gained 1% or more — market commentators weren’t necessarily convinced. “The word — ‘transitory’ — is back at the Federal Reserve as Chair Powell characterizes the price effects of tariffs as a one-off,” economist Mohamed A. El-Erian posted on X. “I would have thought that, particularly after the big policy mistake of earlier this decade and given all the current uncertainties, some Fed officials would show greater humility. It’s simply too early to say with any regress of confidence that the inflationary effects will be transitory.” Gold continued to rise after surpassing the $3,000 mark on Tuesday and today hit a new record above $3,050. Callie Cox, chief market strategist at Ritholtz Wealth Management, said that the U.S. central bank was signaling that any additional rate cuts would likely happen at the cost of battering stocks. “The Fed is no longer comfortable gliding to neutral as we get closer to their inflation target. I think you can argue that the soft landing is over,” she posted.  Tom writes about markets, bitcoin mining and crypto adoption in Latin America.

"The Protocol: Meet Hoodi, Ethereum’s New Testnet",https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2025/03/19/the-protocol-meet-hoodi-ethereum-s-new-testnet,"Welcome to The Protocol, CoinDesk's weekly wrap-up of the most important stories in cryptocurrency tech development. I'm Margaux Nijkerk, CoinDesk’s Ethereum Reporter. In this issue: This article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday. HELLO, HOODI: ETHEREUM WELCOMES A NEW TESTNET: Ethereum developers launched a new test network, Hoodi, this week that will be used to carry out the blockchain's upcoming “Pectra” upgrade. Pectra will go live on Hoodi on March 26, and if all goes well, the long-awaited upgrade will proceed to Ethereum's mainnet roughly 30 days later, according to the network's core developers. Hoodi was created following faulty Pectra tests on Ethereum’s other testnets, Holesky and Sepolia, which failed to finalize properly due to problems with how they were configured. Test networks like Holesky, Sepolia, and Hoodi aim to mimic the main Ethereum network — allowing developers the opportunity to test out code changes or major upgrades like Pectra in a low-stakes environment before deploying them to the mainnet. — Margaux Nijkerk Read more. MICROSOFT RAISES ALARM OF MALWARE TARGETING COINBASE, METAMASK WALLETS: Tech giant Microsoft shared a new report warning of malware that targets 20 of the most popular cryptocurrency wallets used with the Google Chrome extension. Microsoft’s Incident Response researchers raised alarms of a new remote access trojan (RAT), dubbed StilachiRAT, which could deploy “sophisticated techniques to evade detection, persist in the target environment, and exfiltrate sensitive data,” the team shared in a blog post. The malware was discovered in November 2024, and it could steal users' wallet information, and any credentials, including usernames and passwords, stored in their Google Chrome browser. StilachiRAT targets 20 crypto wallets including some of the most widely-used ones like MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, Phantom, OKX Wallet, and BNB Chain Wallet. While the malware has not been distributed widely, Microsoft did share that it has not been able to identify what entity is behind the threat and laid out some mitigation guidelines for current targets including installing antivirus software. — Margaux Nijkerk Read more. HALLIDAY RAISES $20M FOR AI PROTOCOL TO ELIMINATE WRITING SMART CONTRACTS FOR DEFI: Artificial intelligence (AI)-focused blockchain protocol Halliday said it raised $20 million to help fund development of its Agentic Workflow Protocol (AWP), which aims to speed development of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and avoid the need for programmers to write smart contracts. The Series A funding round was led by venture capital giant Andreessen Horowitz's (a16z) crypto arm.

Ethereum to Sunset ‘Holesky’ Testnet in September,https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2025/03/19/ethereum-to-sunset-holesky-testnet-in-september,"Ethereum is set to discontinue its largest test network, Holesky, after it encountered challenges testing the forthcoming Pectra upgrade.  The Ethereum Foundation (EF) said in a blog post on Tuesday that the network — a controlled environment for testing Ethereum infrastructure and upgrades — will begin winding down, with a full shutdown anticipated on Sept. 30. The just-launched Hoodi test network, deployed on Monday, will serve as Holesky's replacement.  The deprecation plan comes after Holesky fell offline due to February's faulty test of Ethereum’s upcoming Pectra update. Developers took weeks to recover Holesky, which came back online in March but suffered from residual damage — so-called ""inactivity leaks"" that clogged up Holesky's entire validator apparatus.  “[E]xited validators would take approximately one year to fully be removed from the validator set,” the EF explained in their blog post. “The size of the exit queue prevents Holesky from being used to test the full validator lifecycle within a reasonable timeframe.”  Ethereum runs testnets so that developers can run code changes before bringing them to Ethereum’s main network (mainnet). Test networks essentially replicate the Ethereum mainnet, and they allow developer teams and infrastructure providers to test out new software before launching them in a more high-stakes environment.  Holesky was specifically intended for testing by Ethereum's validator ecosystem — the stakers and node operators that keep the Ethereum network up and running. It was built to model close-to-real network conditions with its support for a giant 1.4 million validators — more than Goerli, which Holesky replaced in 2023, and even the real Ethereum network.  Currently, Holesky is used by validators and staking providers, but the similarly-constructed Hoodi network will serve that function moving forward. Hoodi went live earlier this week and plans to test the Pectra upgrade on March 26. Should that test proceed smoothly, developers intend to push Pectra onto Ethereum’s mainnet 30 days later.  “Stakers, this is your new testing ground,” said Tim Beiko, the protocol support lead at the EF, in a post on X.

"Bitcoin, Ether, Solana Likely to See 3%- 5% Price Swings on FOMC Rate Decision, Volmex's Data Suggests",https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/03/19/bitcoin-ether-and-solana-likely-to-see-3-5-price-swings-on-fomc-rate-decision-volmex-s-data-suggests,"The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the U.S. Federal Reserve's monetary policy-making body, is slated to publish its rate review later in the day, along with growth and inflation projections and interest rate forecast. The widely-watched event is likely to breed crypto market volatility, spurring 3% to 5% price swings in bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and solana (SOL). That's the message from Volmex's one-day implied volatility indices tied to BTC, ETH and SOL. At 12:30 UTC, the bitcoin one-day IV index (BVIV) signaled an annualized volatility of 63.32%, equating to an expected 24-hour price swing of 3.31%. The daily move is calculated by dividing the annualized figure by the square root of 365, the total number of trading days in a year. Similarly, ether and solana volatility indices suggested 24-hour price swings of 5.25% and 5.73%, respectively. These figures might be scary for equity or currency traders but do not represent a major deviation from the normal in the crypto market. In other words, the Fed event, though pivotal, is unlikely to result in an immediate volatility explosion. The central bank is widely expected to keep the benchmark borrowing cost steady while signaling an end of its prolonged quantitive tightening program. However, gains in risk assets may be tempered by a potential stagflationary adjustment in the summary of economic projections.

Blockdaemon Acquires DeFi Connectivity Firm Expand to Bring Institutions to Web3,https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/03/19/blockdaemon-acquires-defi-connectivity-firm-expand-to-bring-institutions-to-web3,"Blockdaemon, a leading provider of crypto infrastructure, has acquired expand.network, a single API connection into the multifarious world of decentralized finance (DeFi), with a view to enabling big financial institutions to seamlessly access on-chain trading. The exact price paid for expand.network was not revealed, but Blockdaemon said the deal was worth double digit millions of dollars. The firm provides API access to DeFi, enabling connections to over 170 endpoints, including DEXs, bridges, lending protocols and oracles. As long-awaited regulatory clarity comes to crypto in the U.S., banks and large financial institutions are considering a point of entry into the on-chain finance world. Blockdaemon, which counts banks like Goldman Sachs among its backers, assists around 70% of top 500 institutions active in crypto, which includes running over 250,000 nodes across 40 data centers, as well as handling staking rewards, and more recently establishing cross-blockchain, self-custody wallet offerings for big players. The next logical step for banks and institutions is providing easy access via Blockdaemon’s interoperable, staking-ready wallets into the complex realm of DeFi lending, borrowing and automated liquidity, said Konstantin Richter, founder and CEO of Blockdaemon. “DeFi will make running financial infrastructure a lot cheaper for banks and institutions and it’s where a lot of institutional benefits will reside over time,” Richter said in an interview. “It's still very early and obviously there's a lot that still needs to happen in terms of regulatory clarity, adoption and decentralization. But the time is right to accelerate that particular vertical within our product suite.” UPDATE (March, 19, 13:10 UTC): changes from Expand to expand.network  Ian Allison is a senior reporter at CoinDesk, focused on institutional and enterprise adoption of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.

Ether Jumps 7% as Bitcoin Traders Watch $80K Support Ahead of FOMC,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/03/19/ether-zooms-7-as-bitcoin-traders-watch-usd80k-support-ahead-of-fomc,"Ether (ETH) zoomed nearly 7% in the past 24 hours to lead gains among majors as traders await the results of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on Wednesday. ETH’s gains were coupled with a 4% gain in memecoin dogecoin (DOGE), which historically tends to act correlated to the asset’s movements. Other Ethereum-based memecoins pepe (PEPE) and mog (MOG), rose more than 5% — continuing to act as levered bets. Elsewhere, majors XRP, BNB Chain’s BNB, Solana’s SOL and Cardano’s ADA rose 3%. Tron’s TRX dipped after a surge 5% earlier in the day as memecoin trading picked up on the blockchain following a no-fee update in the Sunpump platform. Bitcoin (BTC) rose 2% and remained steady under $84,000 in Asian evening hours ahead of the FOMC, where traders expect rates to be held steady. The $80,000 mark remains one to be watched, some say, as a break below would mean a critical support level vanishes. The widely-watched ETH/BTC ratio - or the trading pair of ether against bitcoin - rose from 0.23 to 0.24 since Asian morning hours, indicative of a bump in demand for riskier ETH versus the perceived safety of bitcoin. Ether rose on no immediate catalyst, but the mothership network has technical catalysts in the making. The Pectra upgrade, Ethereum's next major update, is currently in testing and aims to improve scalability, staking, and user experience with over 20 EIPs, including EIP-7702 (smart account functionality) and EIP-7251 (raising validator staking limits to 2,048 ETH). Testing began on Holesky in February 2025, followed by Sepolia in March, but faced challenges like transaction processing issues due to client incompatibilities. A new testnet, Hooli, launched on March 17, with Pectra testing scheduled for March 26. If successful, mainnet deployment is expected in late April or early May 2025. “BTC has found some support at the $80K, but that seems tenuous at best amid broader macro weakness,” traders at Singapore-based QCP Capital said in a broadcast message. “We won’t attempt to call the exact moment when the music stops, but in the short term, we struggle to identify meaningful tailwinds to reverse this rout.” “We will be watching closely for any dovish shifts, particularly on growth and inflation expectations. Given that it will take months for the impact of tariffs to ripple through the economy, we expect the Fed to remain in “wait-and-see” mode,” QCP added. Meanwhile, gold broke above $3,000 to new highs earlier Wednesday, leading to some eyeing an inverse correlation of the yellow metal with bitcoin. “Despite its historical correlation with gold as a macro hedge, Bitcoin's current divergence—falling while gold rises—suggests it's acting more like a risk asset, influenced by Fed policy uncertainty, profit-taking, and a shift to traditional safe-havens,” Ryan Lee, Chief Analyst at Bitget Research, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. “The FOMC outcome could either trigger a recovery if dovish or deepen the correction if hawkish, with bitcoin's short-term trajectory tied to broader economic signals rather than solely reinforcing its ""digital gold"" role,” Lee added.

"Erdogan Rival's Arrest Sends Lira to Record Low, Bitcoin-TRY Volume Surging on Binance",https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/03/19/turkish-lira-crashes-to-record-low-spurring-volume-surge-in-binance-s-bitcoin-lira-pair,"The Turkish lira (TRY) fell to a record low against the dollar following the surprise arrest of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's rival and Istanbul mayor Ekrem Imamoglu. The currency slumped a record of nearly 41 per U.S. dollar, a 10% slide on the day. The volatility saw a sharp rise in trading volumes in the bitcoin-lira (BTC/TRY) pair on leading cryptocurrency exchange Binance. Imamoglu's Republican People’s Party (CHP) described the arrest as a coup to replace the will of the people. The party was set to hold a primary election next week, with Imamoglu widely expected to emerge as the presidential candidate. On Binance, the BTC/TRY pair saw 93 BTC change hands between 7:00 UTC and 8:00 UTC, according to data source TradingView. That's the highest hourly volume in at least a year. Still, when adjusted for the lira's exchange rate, BTC traded at a massive discount to prices on Coinbase (COIN).  It's possible traders sold BTC/TRY to move money into dollar-linked assets like USDT, the largest stablecoin. CoinDesk reached out to Binance for a comment on the matter. Fiat-currency volatility is not new to Turkey and over the years it has galvanized demand for hard assets like gold and alternative assets like stablecoins and cryptocurrencies. The lira has consistently depreciated since at least 2017, when it 3.53 to the dollar.

"Crypto Daybook Americas: Bitcoin ETFs, Frog-Themed Tokens See Renewed Interest",https://www.coindesk.com/daybook-us/2025/03/20/crypto-daybook-americas-bitcoin-etfs-frog-themed-tokens-see-renewed-interest,"You are viewing Crypto Daybook Americas, your new morning briefing on what happened in the crypto markets overnight and what's expected during the coming day. Crypto Daybook Americas will arrive in your inbox at 7 a.m. ET to kickstart your morning with comprehensive insights. If you're not already subscribed, click here. You won't want to start your day without it. By Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) Bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and the broader crypto market are facing renewed pressure, reversing some of gains made after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell downplayed concerns about tariff-driven inflation . President Donald Trump is reportedly scheduled to speak at Blockworks' Digital Asset Summit in New York later, with traders keen to hear how the administration plans to acquire BTC in a budget-neutral manner. Don't get too excited, the likelihood of such an announcement remains low. Trump is more likely to reiterate his aspiration to make America the ""crypto capital of the world,"" and even this may overwhelm markets. On a more positive note, renewed interest in U.S.-listed spot ETFs supports market strength. On Wednesday, bitcoin ETFs experienced a total net inflow of $11.8 million, a fourth consecutive day of positive flows, according to Farside Investors. In contrast, ether spot ETFs recorded a net outflow of $11.7 million, extending a streak of withdrawals to 11 straight days. ""Several catalysts continue to support a bullish outlook,"" Blockhead Research Network said. ""The U.S. government exploring budget-neutral ways to accumulate bitcoin could be a game-changing factor for this cycle. Additionally, solana futures being added to the CME is a major bullish indicator for altcoins, potentially increasing institutional exposure to SOL.""  Speaking of on-chain flows, data from IntoTheBlock reveals that whales now hold some 62,000 more BTC than they did at the beginning of the month, indicating a resurgence in accumulation following nearly a year of declining balances. XRP whales have also been buying over the past two months. For its part, the SUI token has remained resilient, looking to build on its Wednesday gains in the wake of Canary Capital Group, an institutional crypto trading and management firm, filing for a Sui exchange-traded fund (ETF) with the SEC. In wider market news, a domain claim page for Hyperlane, an open interoperability framework, surfaced, sparking speculation of a potential token airdrop on social media. Traditional markets offered mixed cues, with dollar-yen staring at a death cross pattern, teasing a major surge ahead in the Japanese currency, which is seen as an anti-risk holding. Meanwhile, copper neared a record high in a positive sign for risky assets. Stay alert!

"Gold Surges, Bitcoin Rallies, Stocks Down Since Trump's Electoral Win—What’s Driving the Chaos?",https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/03/20/gold-surges-bitcoin-rallies-stocks-down-since-trump-s-electoral-win-what-s-driving-the-chaos,"Pro-crypto Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election over four months ago, and since then, the period has been characterized by financial market turbulence and global uncertainties surrounding tariffs, geopolitical tensions, and ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and between Ukraine and Russia. Bitcoin (BTC) has surged over 23% since the Nov. 5 election, reaching an all-time high of over $109K at the end of January. Despite a subsequent 30% decline from its peak, it remains one of the best-performing assets. Strategy (MSTR), often considered a bitcoin proxy, has gained 34%, recovering well under the Trump administration despite previously dropping around 60% from its November highs. Ethereum's ether token (ETH) has fallen by as much as 18%, alongside disappointing action in the broader crypto market. The Valkyrie Bitcoin Mining ETF has also struggled, dropping almost 30%. Meanwhile, investors have rotated money into BTC, pushing its dominance rate higher by 2% to over 61.  European equities have done well, outshining their U.S. counterparts. The German DAX index is up 20%, and the UK’s FTSE 100 has gained 6%, alongside weaker performances in the U.S. stock market, where the Nasdaq and S&P 500 are both down approximately 2%. A recent report from Bank of America highlights a record drop in U.S. stock allocations. Gold, benefiting from uncertainty, has continued to set new all-time highs, surpassing $3,030—an 11% increase. The U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the dollar's strength against a basket of major currencies, remains flat. However, under Trump, the dollar has weakened significantly, providing some relief to risk assets and major currencies such as the Euro and the Great British Pound. Meanwhile, the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield has slightly declined to 4.2%, a key metric the administration is closely monitoring. Oil prices have plummeted by around 7% as the U.S. maintains its stance on energy dominance to reduce energy costs.  Notably, some of the so-called ""Magnificent 7"" stocks have struggled, with NVIDIA (NVDA) down 16% and Tesla (TSLA) declining 6%. Recent losses on Wall Street and in the crypto market have ignited hopes for the ""Trump put,"" or potential policy support. However, the administration appears willing to endure short-term pain for long-term benefits, believing that this approach will cleanse the markets of the fiscal spending excesses of the Biden era.  This reset is expected to be characterized lower inflation, improved energy security, and a lower 10-year Treasury yield. ""Scott Bessent’s talk of a “detox period” suggests a controlled downturn might be ahead. If that’s the case, Trump’s playbook seems clear: blame the recession on Biden, use tariffs and crypto narratives to manage costs, and push for lower interest rates to fuel tech and AI growth. Short-term pain, long-term gain—that’s the strategy,"" Gracy Chen, CEO of Bitget, said in an email to CoinDesk this week.  ""Regardless, I don't see BTC falling below 70k, possibly 73-78k which is a solid time to enter for any buyers on the fence. In the next 1-2 years, BTC at 200k isn’t as far-fetched as most would think,"" Chen added.
